A COLLECTION OF THE<br />
FOLK-TALES AND LEGENDS OF<br />
NORTH WALES<br />
BEING THE PRIZE ESSAY OF THE NATIONAL EISTEDDFOD<br />
1887, BY THE<br />
REV. ELIAS OWEN, M.A, F.S.A.</p>
<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>To this Essay on the &ldquo;Folk-lore of North Wales,&rdquo; was awarded
the first prize at the Welsh National Eisteddfod, held in London, in
1887.&nbsp; The prize consisted of a silver medal, and &pound;20.&nbsp; The
adjudicators were Canon Silvan Evans, Professor Rhys, and Mr Egerton
Phillimore, editor of the <i>Cymmrodor</i>.</p>
<p>By an arrangement with the Eisteddfod Committee, the work became the
property of the publishers, Messrs. Woodall, Minshall, &amp; Co., who, at
the request of the author, entrusted it to him for revision, and the
present Volume is the result of his labours.</p>
<p>Before undertaking the publishing of the work, it was necessary to
obtain a sufficient number of subscribers to secure the publishers from
loss.&nbsp; Upwards of two hundred ladies and gentlemen gave their names to
the author, and the work of publication was commenced.&nbsp; The names of
the subscribers appear at the end of the book, and the writer thanks them
one and all for their kind support.&nbsp; It is more than probable that the
work would never have been published had it not been for their kind
assistance.&nbsp; Although the study of Folk-lore is of growing interest,
and its importance to the historian is being acknowledged; still, the
publishing of a work on the subject involved a considerable risk of loss to
the printers, which, however, has been removed in this case, at least to a
certain extent, by those who have subscribed for the work.</p>
<p>The sources of the information contained in this essay are various, but
the writer is indebted, chiefly, to the aged <!-- page iv--><a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>inhabitants of Wales,
for his information.&nbsp; In the discharge of his official duties, as
Diocesan Inspector of Schools, he visited annually, for seventeen years,
every parish in the Diocese of St. Asaph, and he was thus brought into
contact with young and old.&nbsp; He spent several years in Carnarvonshire,
and he had a brother, the Revd. Elijah Owen, M.A., a Vicar in Anglesey,
from whom he derived much information.&nbsp; By his journeys he became
acquainted with many people in North Wales, and he hardly ever failed in
obtaining from them much singular and valuable information of bye-gone
days, which there and then he dotted down on scraps of paper, and
afterwards transferred to note books, which still are in his
possession.</p>
<p>It was his custom, after the labour of school inspection was over, to
ask the clergy with whom he was staying to accompany him to the most aged
inhabitants of their parish.&nbsp; This they willingly did, and often in
the dark winter evenings, lantern in hand, they sallied forth on their
journey, and in this way a rich deposit of traditions and superstitions was
struck and rescued from oblivion.&nbsp; Not a few of the clergy were
themselves in full possession of all the quaint sayings and Folk-lore of
their parishes, and they were not loath to transfer them to the
writer&rsquo;s keeping.&nbsp; In the course of this work, the writer gives
the names of the many aged friends who supplied him with information, and
also the names of the clergy who so willingly helped him in his
investigations.&nbsp; But so interesting was the matter obtained from
several of his clerical friends, that he thinks he ought in justice to
acknowledge their services in this preface.&nbsp; First and foremost comes
up to his mind, the Rev. R. Jones, formerly Rector of Llanycil, Bala, but
now of Llysfaen, near Abergele.&nbsp; This gentleman&rsquo;s memory is
stored with reminiscences of former days, and often and again his name
occurs in these pages.&nbsp; The Rev. Canon Owen Jones, formerly Vicar of
Pentrefoelas, but now of Bodelwyddan, near Rhyl, also supplied much
interesting information of <!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. v</span>the people&rsquo;s doings in former days, and I
may state that this gentleman is also acquainted with Welsh literature to
an extent seldom to be met with in the person of an isolated Welsh parson
far removed from books and libraries.&nbsp; To him I am indebted for the
perusal of many MSS.&nbsp; To the Rev. David James, formerly Rector of
Garthbeibio, now of Pennant, and to his predecessor the Rev. W. E. Jones,
Bylchau; the late Rev. Ellis Roberts (Elis Wyn o Wyrfai); the Rev. M.
Hughes, Derwen; the Rev. W. J. Williams, Llanfihangel-Glyn-Myfyr, and in a
great degree to his aged friend, the Rev. E. Evans, Llanfihangel, near
Llanfyllin, whose conversation in and love of Welsh literature of all
kinds, including old Welsh Almanacks, was almost without limit, and whose
knowledge and thorough sympathy with his countrymen made his company most
enjoyable.&nbsp; To him and to all these gentlemen above named, and to
others, whose names appear in the body of this work, the writer is greatly
indebted, and he tenders his best thanks to them all.</p>
<p>The many books from which quotations are made are all mentioned in
connection with the information extracted from their pages.</p>
<p>Welsh Folk-lore is almost inexhaustible, and in these pages the writer
treats of only one branch of popular superstitions.&nbsp; Ancient customs
are herein only incidentally referred to, but they are very interesting,
and worthy of a full description.&nbsp; Superstitions associated with
particular days and seasons are also omitted.&nbsp; Weather signs are
passed over, Holy wells around which cluster superstitions of bye-gone days
form no part of this essay.&nbsp; But on all these, and other branches of
Folk-lore, the author has collected much information from the aged Welsh
peasant, and possibly some day in the uncertain future he may publish a
continuation of the present volume.</p>
<p>He has already all but finished a volume on the Holy Wells of North
Wales, and this he hopes to publish at no very distance period.</p>
<p><!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>The author has endeavoured in all instances to give the names of
his informants, but often and again, when pencil and paper were produced,
he was requested not to mention in print the name of the person who was
speaking to him.&nbsp; This request was made, not because the information
was incorrect, but from false delicacy; still, in every instance, the
writer respected this request.&nbsp; He, however, wishes to state
emphatically that he has authority for every single bit of Folk-lore
recorded.&nbsp; Very often his work was merely that of a translator, for
most of his information, derived from the people, was spoken in Welsh, but
he has given in every instance a literal rendering of the narrative, just
as he heard it, without embellishments or additions of any kind
whatsoever.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
FAIRIES.</h2>
<h3>ORIGIN OF THE FAIRIES.&nbsp; (Y TYLWYTH T&Ecirc;G.)</h3>
<p>The Fairy tales that abound in the Principality have much in common with
like legends in other countries.&nbsp; This points to a common origin of
all such tales.&nbsp; There is a real and unreal, a mythical and a material
aspect to Fairy Folk-Lore.&nbsp; The prevalence, the obscurity, and the
different versions of the same Fairy tale show that their origin dates from
remote antiquity.&nbsp; The supernatural and the natural are strangely
blended together in these legends, and this also points to their great age,
and intimates that these wild and imaginative Fairy narratives had some
historical foundation.&nbsp; If carefully sifted, these legends will yield
a fruitful harvest of ancient thoughts and facts connected with the history
of a people, which, as a race, is, perhaps, now extinct, but which has, to
a certain extent, been merged into a stronger and more robust race, by whom
they were conquered, and dispossessed of much of their land.&nbsp; The
conquerors of the Fair Tribe have transmitted to us tales of their timid,
unwarlike, but truthful predecessors of the soil, and these tales shew that
for a time both races were co-inhabitants of the land, and to a certain
extent, by stealth, intermarried.</p>
<p>Fairy tales, much alike in character, are to be heard in many countries,
peopled by branches of the Aryan race, and consequently these stories in
outline, were most probably in existence before the separation of the
families belonging <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>to that race.&nbsp; It is not improbable that
the emigrants would carry with them, into all countries whithersoever they
went, their ancestral legends, and they would find no difficulty in
supplying these interesting stories with a home in their new country.&nbsp;
If this supposition be correct, we must look for the origin of Fairy
Mythology in the cradle of the Aryan people, and not in any part of the
world inhabited by descendants of that great race.</p>
<p>But it is not improbable that incidents in the process of colonization
would repeat themselves, or under special circumstances vary, and thus we
should have similar and different versions of the same historical event in
all countries once inhabited by a diminutive race, which was overcome by a
more powerful people.</p>
<p>In Wales Fairy legends have such peculiarities that they seem to be
historical fragments of by-gone days.&nbsp; And apparently they refer to a
race which immediately preceded the Celt in the occupation of the country,
and with which the Celt to a limited degree amalgamated.</p>
<h3>NAMES GIVEN TO THE FAIRIES.</h3>
<p>The Fairies have, in Wales, at least three common and distinctive names,
as well as others that are not nowadays used.</p>
<p>The first and most general name given to the Fairies is &ldquo;<i>Y
Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>,&rdquo; or, the Fair Tribe, an expressive and
descriptive term.&nbsp; They are spoken of as a people, and not as myths or
goblins, and they are said to be a fair or handsome race.</p>
<p>Another common name for the Fairies, is, &ldquo;<i>Bendith y
Mamau</i>,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The Mothers&rsquo; Blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
Doctor Owen Pughe&rsquo;s Dictionary they are called &ldquo;Bendith
<i>eu</i> Mamau,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;<i>Their</i> Mothers&rsquo;
Blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first is the most common expression, at least in
North Wales.&nbsp; It is a <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>singularly strange expression, and difficult to
explain.&nbsp; Perhaps it hints at a Fairy origin on the mother&rsquo;s
side of certain fortunate people.</p>
<p>The third name given to Fairies is &ldquo;<i>Ellyll</i>,&rdquo; an elf,
a demon, a goblin.&nbsp; This name conveys these beings to the land of
spirits, and makes them resemble the oriental Genii, and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sportive elves.&nbsp; It agrees, likewise, with the
modern popular creed respecting goblins and their doings.</p>
<p>Davydd ab Gwilym, in a description of a mountain mist in which he was
once enveloped, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yr ydoedd ym mhob gobant<br />
<i>Ellyllon</i> mingeimion gant.</p>
<p>There were in every hollow<br />
A hundred wrymouthed elves.</p>
<p><i>The Cambro-Briton</i>, v. I., p. 348.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pembrokeshire the Fairies are called <i>Dynon Buch T&ecirc;g</i>, or
the <i>Fair Small People</i>.</p>
<p>Another name applied to the Fairies is <i>Plant Annwfn</i>, or <i>Plant
Annwn</i>.&nbsp; This, however, is not an appellation in common use.&nbsp;
The term is applied to the Fairies in the third paragraph of a Welsh prose
poem called <i>Bardd Cwsg</i>, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Y bwriodd y <i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> fi . . . oni bai fy nyfod i mewn<br
/>
pryd i&rsquo;th achub o gigweiniau <i>Plant Annwfn</i>.</p>
<p>Where the <i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> threw me . . . if I had not come<br
/>
in time to rescue thee from the clutches of <i>Plant Annwfn</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Annwn</i>, or <i>Annwfn</i> is defined in Canon Silvan Evans&rsquo;s
Dictionary as an abyss, Hades, etc.&nbsp; <i>Plant Annwn</i>, therefore,
means children of the lower regions.&nbsp; It is a name derived from the
supposed place of abode&mdash;the bowels of the earth&mdash;of the
Fairies.&nbsp; <i>Gwragedd Annwn</i>, dames of Elfin land, is a term
applied to Fairy ladies.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Ellis
Wynne, the author of <i>Bardd Cwsg</i>, was born in 1671, and the
probability is that the words <i>Plant Annwfn</i> formed in his days part
of the vocabulary of the people.&nbsp; He was born in Merionethshire.</p>
<p><i>Gwyll</i>, according to Richards, and Dr. Owen Pughe, is a Fairy, a
goblin, etc.&nbsp; The plural of <i>Gwyll</i> would be <i>Gwylliaid</i>, or
<i>Gwyllion</i>, but this latter word Dr. Pughe defines as ghosts,
hobgoblins, etc.&nbsp; Formerly, there was in Merionethshire a red haired
family of robbers called <i>Y Gwylliaid Cochion</i>, or Red Fairies, of
whom I shall speak hereafter.</p>
<p><i>Coblynau</i>, or Knockers, have been described as a species of
Fairies, whose abode was within the rocks, and whose province it was to
indicate to the miners by the process of knocking, etc., the presence of
rich lodes of lead or other metals in this or that direction of the
mine.</p>
<p>That the words <i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> and <i>Ellyll</i> are
convertible terms appears from the following stanza, which is taken from
the <i>Cambrian Magazine</i>, vol. ii, p. 58.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pan dramwych ffridd yr Ywen,<br />
Lle mae <i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> yn rhodien,<br />
Dos ymlaen, a phaid a sefyll,<br />
Gwilia&rsquo;th droed&mdash;rhag dawnsva&rsquo;r <i>Ellyll</i>.</p>
<p>When the forest of the Yew,<br />
Where <i>Fairies</i> haunt, thou passest through,<br />
Tarry not, thy footsteps guard<br />
From the <i>Goblins&rsquo;</i> dancing sward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the poet mentions the <i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> and
<i>Ellyll</i> as identical, he might have done so for rhythmical
reasons.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, in the first instance a distinction would be
drawn between these two words, which originally were intended perhaps to
describe two different kinds of beings, but in the course of time the words
became interchangeable, and thus their distinctive character was
lost.&nbsp; In English the words Fairies and elves are used without any
distinction.&nbsp; <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>It would appear from Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular
Antiquities</i>, vol. II., p. 478., that, according to Gervase of Tilbury,
there were two kinds of Goblins in England, called <i>Portuni</i> and
<i>Grant</i>.&nbsp; This division suggests a difference between the
<i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> and the <i>Ellyll</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Portuni</i>,
we are told, were very small of stature and old in appearance,
&ldquo;<i>statura pusilli</i>, <i>dimidium pollicis non
habentes</i>,&rdquo; but then they were &ldquo;<i>senili vultu</i>,
<i>facie corrugata</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wrinkled face and aged countenance
of the <i>Portuni</i> remind us of nursery Fairy tales in which the wee
ancient female Fairy figures.&nbsp; The pranks of the <i>Portuni</i> were
similar to those of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Puck.&nbsp; The species
<i>Grant</i> is not described, and consequently it cannot be ascertained
how far they resembled any of the many kinds of Welsh Fairies.&nbsp;
Gervase, speaking of one of these species, says:&mdash;&ldquo;If anything
should be to be carried on in the house, or any kind of laborious work to
be done, they join themselves to the work, and expedite it with more than
human facility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Scotland there were at least two species of elves, the
<i>Brownies</i> and the <i>Fairies</i>.&nbsp; The Brownies were so called
from their tawny colour, and the Fairies from their fairness.&nbsp; The
<i>Portuni</i> of Gervase appear to have corresponded in character to the
Brownies, who were said to have employed themselves in the night in the
discharge of laborious undertakings acceptable to the family to whose
service they had devoted themselves.&nbsp; The Fairies proper of Scotland
strongly resembled the Fairies of Wales.</p>
<p>The term <i>Brownie</i>, or swarthy elve, suggests a connection between
them and the <i>Gwylliaid Cochion</i>, or Red Fairies of Wales.</p>
<h3>FAIRY LADIES MARRYING MORTALS.</h3>
<p>In the mythology of the Greeks, and other nations, gods and goddesses
are spoken of as falling in love with human <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>beings, and many an
ancient genealogy began with a celestial ancestor.&nbsp; Much the same
thing is said of the Fairies.&nbsp; Tradition speaks of them as being
enamoured of the inhabitants of this earth, and content, for awhile, to be
wedded to mortals.&nbsp; And there are families in Wales who are said to
have Fairy blood coursing through their veins, but they are, or were, not
so highly esteemed as were the offspring of the gods among the
Greeks.&nbsp; The famous physicians of Myddfai, who owed their talent and
supposed supernatural knowledge to their Fairy origin, are, however, an
exception; for their renown, notwithstanding their parentage, was always
great, and increased in greatness, as the rolling years removed them from
their traditionary parent, the Fairy lady of the Van Pool.</p>
<p>The <i>Pellings</i> are said to have sprung from a Fairy Mother, and the
author of <i>Observations on the Snowdon Mountains</i> states that the best
blood in his veins is fairy blood.&nbsp; There are in some parts of Wales
reputed descendants on the female side of the <i>Gwylliaid Cochion</i>
race; and there are other families among us whom the aged of fifty years
ago, with an ominous shake of the head, would say were of Fairy
extraction.&nbsp; We are not, therefore, in Wales void of families of
doubtful parentage or origin.</p>
<p>All the current tales of men marrying Fairy ladies belong to a class of
stories called, technically, Taboo stories.&nbsp; In these tales the lady
marries her lover conditionally, and when this condition is broken she
deserts husband and children, and hies back to Fairy land.</p>
<p>This kind of tale is current among many people.&nbsp; Max M&uuml;ller in
<i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>, vol. ii, pp. 104-6, records one of
these ancient stories, which is found in the Brahma<i>n</i>a of the
Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda.&nbsp; Omitting a few particulars, the story is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Urvasi, a kind of Fairy, fell in love with Pur&ucirc;ravas,
the son of Ida, and when she met him she said, &lsquo;Embrace me three
times a day, but never against my will, and let me never see you without
your royal garments, for this is the manner of women.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this
manner she lived with him a long time, and she was with child.&nbsp; Then
her former friends, the Gandharvas, said: &lsquo;This Urvasi has now dwelt
a long time among mortals; let us see that she come back.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now,
there was a ewe, with two lambs, tied to the couch of Urvasi and
Pur&ucirc;ravas, and the Gandharvas stole one of them.&nbsp; Urvasi said:
&lsquo;They take away my darling, as if I had lived in a land where there
is no hero and no man.&rsquo;&nbsp; They stole the second, and she
upbraided her husband again.&nbsp; Then Pur&ucirc;ravas looked and said:
&lsquo;How can that be a land without heroes and men where I
am?&rsquo;&nbsp; And naked, he sprang up; he thought it too long to put on
his dress.&nbsp; Then the Gandharvas sent a flash of lightning, and Urvasi
saw her husband naked as by daylight.&nbsp; Then she vanished; &lsquo;I
come back,&rsquo; she said, and went.</p>
<p>Pur&ucirc;ravas bewailed his love in bitter grief.&nbsp; But whilst
walking along the border of a lake full of lotus flowers the Fairies were
playing there in the water, in the shape of birds, and Urvasi discovered
him and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the man with whom I dwelt so long.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then her
friends said: &lsquo;Let us appear to him.&rsquo;&nbsp; She agreed, and
they appeared before him.&nbsp; Then the king recognised her, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lo! my wife, stay, thou cruel in mind!&nbsp; Let us now exchange
some words!&nbsp; Our secrets, if they are not told now, will not bring us
back on any later day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She replied: &lsquo;What shall I do with thy speech?&nbsp; I am gone
like the first of the dawns.&nbsp; Pur&ucirc;ravas, go home again, I am
hard to be caught, like the wind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The
Fairy wife by and by relents, and her mortal lover became, by a certain
sacrifice, one of the Gandharvas.</p>
<p>This ancient Hindu Fairy tale resembles in many particulars similar
tales found in Celtic Folk-Lore, and possibly, the original story, in its
main features, existed before the Aryan family had separated.&nbsp; The
very words, &ldquo;I am hard to be caught,&rdquo; appear in one of the
Welsh legends, which shall be hereafter given:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nid hawdd fy nala,<br />
I am hard to be caught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the scene is similar; in both cases the Fairy ladies are discovered
in a lake.&nbsp; The immortal weds the mortal, conditionally, and for
awhile the union seems to be a happy one.&nbsp; But, unwittingly, when
engaged in an undertaking suggested by, or in agreement with the
wife&rsquo;s wishes, the prohibited thing is done, and the lady vanishes
away.</p>
<p>Such are the chief features of these mythical marriages.&nbsp; I will
now record like tales that have found a home in several parts of Wales.</p>
<h3>WELSH LEGENDS OF FAIRY LADIES MARRYING MEN.</h3>
<h4>1.&nbsp; <i>The Pentrevoelas Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>I am indebted to the Rev. Owen Jones, Vicar of Pentrevoelas, a mountain
parish in West Denbighshire, for the following tale, which was written in
Welsh by a native of those parts, and appeared in competition for a prize
on the Folk-Lore of that parish.</p>
<p>The son of Hafodgarreg was shepherding his father&rsquo;s flock on the
hills, and whilst thus engaged, he, one misty morning, came suddenly upon a
lovely girl, seated on the sheltered side of a peat-stack.&nbsp; The maiden
appeared to be in great distress, and she was crying bitterly.&nbsp; The
young man went up to her, and spoke kindly to her, and his attention and
sympathy were not without effect on the comely stranger.&nbsp; <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>So beautiful was
the young woman, that from expressions of sympathy the smitten youth
proceeded to words of love, and his advances were not repelled.&nbsp; But
whilst the lovers were holding sweet conversation, there appeared on the
scene a venerable and aged man, who, addressing the female as her father,
bade her follow him.&nbsp; She immediately obeyed, and both departed
leaving the young man alone.&nbsp; He lingered about the place until the
evening, wishing and hoping that she might return, but she came not.&nbsp;
Early the next day, he was at the spot where he first felt what love
was.&nbsp; All day long he loitered about the place, vainly hoping that the
beautiful girl would pay another visit to the mountain, but he was doomed
to disappointment, and night again drove him homewards.&nbsp; Thus daily
went he to the place where he had met his beloved, but she was not there,
and, love-sick and lonely, he returned to Hafodgarreg.&nbsp; Such devotion
deserved its reward.&nbsp; It would seem that the young lady loved the
young man quite as much as he loved her.&nbsp; And in the land of
allurement and illusion (yn nhir hud a lledrith) she planned a visit to the
earth, and met her lover, but she was soon missed by her father, and he,
suspecting her love for this young man, again came upon them, and found
them conversing lovingly together.&nbsp; Much talk took place between the
sire and his daughter, and the shepherd, waxing bold, begged and begged her
father to give him his daughter in marriage.&nbsp; The sire, perceiving
that the man was in earnest, turned to his daughter, and asked her whether
it were her wish to marry a man of the earth?&nbsp; She said it was.&nbsp;
Then the father told the shepherd he should have his daughter to wife, and
that she should stay with him, until he should strike her with <i>iron</i>,
and that, as a marriage portion, he would give her a bag filled with bright
money.&nbsp; The young couple were duly married, and the promised dowry was
received.&nbsp; For many years they lived lovingly <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and happily together,
and children were born to them.&nbsp; One day this man and his wife went
together to the hill to catch a couple of ponies, to carry them to the
Festival of the Saint of Capel Garmon.&nbsp; The ponies were very wild, and
could not be caught.&nbsp; The man, irritated, pursued the nimble
creatures.&nbsp; His wife was by his side, and now he thought he had them
in his power, but just at the moment he was about to grasp their manes, off
they wildly galloped, and the man, in anger, finding that they had again
eluded him, threw the bridle after them, and, sad to say, the bit struck
the wife, and as this was of <i>iron</i> they both knew that their marriage
contract was broken.&nbsp; Hardly had they had time to realise the dire
accident, ere the aged father of the bride appeared, accompanied by a host
of Fairies, and there and then departed with his daughter to the land
whence she came, and that, too, without even allowing her to bid farewell
to her children.&nbsp; The money, though, and the children were left
behind, and these were the only memorials of the lovely wife and the
kindest of mothers, that remained to remind the shepherd of the treasure he
had lost in the person of his Fairy spouse.</p>
<p>Such is the Pentrevoelas Legend.&nbsp; The writer had evidently not seen
the version of this story in the <i>Cambro-Briton</i>, nor had he read
Williams&rsquo;s tale of a like occurrence, recorded in <i>Observations on
the Snowdon Mountains</i>.&nbsp; The account, therefore, is all the more
valuable, as being an independent production.</p>
<p>A fragmentary variant of the preceding legend was given me by Mr. Lloyd,
late schoolmaster of Llanfihangel-Glyn-Myfyr, a native of South Wales, who
heard the tale in the parish of Llanfihangel.&nbsp; Although but a
fragment, it may not be altogether useless, and I will give it as I
received it:&mdash;</p>
<p>Shon Rolant, Hafod y Dre, Pentrevoelas, when going <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>home from Llanrwst
market, fortunately caught a Fairy-maid, whom he took home with him.&nbsp;
She was a most handsome woman, but rather short and slight in person.&nbsp;
She was admired by everybody on account of her great beauty.&nbsp; Shon
Rolant fell desperately in love with her, and would have married her, but
this she would not allow.&nbsp; He, however, continued pressing her to
become his wife, and, by and by, she consented to do so, provided he could
find out her name.&nbsp; As Shon was again going home from the market about
a month later, he heard some one saying, near the place where he had seized
the Fairy-maid, &ldquo;Where is little Penloi gone?&nbsp; Where is little
Penloi gone?&rdquo;&nbsp; Shon at once thought that some one was searching
for the Fairy he had captured, and when he reached home, he addressed the
Fairy by the name he had heard, and Penloi consented to become his
wife.&nbsp; She, however, expressed displeasure at marrying a dead man, as
the Fairies call us.&nbsp; She informed her lover that she was not to be
touched with <i>iron</i>, or she would disappear at once.&nbsp; Shon took
great care not to touch her with <i>iron</i>.&nbsp; However, one day, when
he was on horseback talking to his beloved Penloi, who stood at the
horse&rsquo;s head, the horse suddenly threw up its head, and the curb,
which was of <i>iron</i>, came in contact with Penloi, who immediately
vanished out of sight.</p>
<p>The next legend is taken from Williams&rsquo;s <i>Observations on the
Snowdon Mountains</i>.&nbsp; His work was published in 1802.&nbsp; He,
himself, was born in Anglesey, in 1738, and migrated to Carnarvonshire
about the year 1760.&nbsp; It was in this latter county that he became a
learned antiquary, and a careful recorder of events that came under his
notice.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Observations&rdquo; throw considerable light upon
the life, the customs, and the traditions of the inhabitants of the hill
parts and secluded glens of Carnarvonshire.&nbsp; I have thought fit to
make these few remarks about the author <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>I quote from, so as to
enable the reader to give to him that credence which he is entitled
to.&nbsp; Williams entitles the following story, &ldquo;A Fairy
Tale,&rdquo; but I will for the sake of reference call it &ldquo;The Ystrad
Legend.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; <i>The Ystrad Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;In a meadow belonging to Ystrad, bounded by the river which falls
from Cwellyn Lake, they say the Fairies used to assemble, and dance on fair
moon-light-nights.&nbsp; One evening a young man, who was the heir and
occupier of this farm, hid himself in a thicket close to the spot where
they used to gambol; presently they appeared, and when in their merry mood,
out he bounced from his covert and seized one of their females; the rest of
the company dispersed themselves, and disappeared in an instant.&nbsp;
Disregarding her struggles and screams, he hauled her to his home, where he
treated her so very kindly that she became content to live with him as his
maid servant; but he could not prevail upon her to tell him her name.&nbsp;
Some time after, happening again to see the Fairies upon the same spot, he
heard one of them saying, &lsquo;The last time we met here, our sister
<i>Penelope</i> was snatched away from us by one of the
mortals!&rsquo;&nbsp; Rejoiced at knowing the name of his <i>Incognita</i>,
he returned home; and as she was very beautiful, and extremely active, he
proposed to marry her, which she would not for a long time consent to; at
last, however, she complied, but on this condition, &lsquo;That if ever he
should strike her with iron, she would leave him, and never return to him
again.&rsquo;&nbsp; They lived happily for many years together, and he had
by her a son, and a daughter; and by her industry and prudent management as
a house-wife he became one of the richest men in the country.&nbsp; He
farmed, besides his own freehold, all the lands on the north side of
Nant-y-Bettws to the top <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of Snowdon, and all Cwmbrwynog in Llanberis; an
extent of about five thousand acres or upwards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one day Penelope followed her husband into the field to
catch a horse; and he, being in a rage at the animal as he ran away from
him, threw at him the bridle that was in his hand, which unluckily fell on
poor Penelope.&nbsp; She disappeared in an instant, and he never saw her
afterwards, but heard her voice in the window of his room one night after,
requesting him to take care of the children, in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rhag bod anwyd ar fy mab,<br />
Yn rhodd rhowch arno g&ocirc;b ei dad,<br />
Rhag bod anwyd ar liw&rsquo;r cann,<br />
Rhoddwch arni bais ei mam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh! lest my son should suffer cold,<br />
Him in his father&rsquo;s coat infold,<br />
Lest cold should seize my darling fair,<br />
For her, her mother&rsquo;s robe prepare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These children and their descendants, they say, were called
<i>Pellings</i>; a word corrupted from their mother&rsquo;s name,
Penelope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams proceeds thus with reference to the descendants of this
union:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late Thomas Rowlands, Esq., of Caerau, in Anglesey, the
father of the late Lady Bulkeley, was a descendant of this lady, if it be
true that the name <i>Pellings</i> came from her; and there are still
living several opulent and respectable people who are known to have sprung
from the <i>Pellings</i>.&nbsp; The best blood in my own veins is this
Fairy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tale was chronicled in the last century, but it is not known
whether every particular incident connected therewith was recorded by
Williams.&nbsp; <i>Glasynys</i>, the Rev. Owen Wynne Jones, a clergyman,
relates a tale in the <i>Brython</i>, <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>which he regards as the
same tale as that given by Williams, and he says that he heard it scores of
times when he was a lad.&nbsp; <i>Glasynys</i> was born in the parish of
Rhostryfan, Carnarvonshire, in 1827, and as his birth place is not far
distant from the scene of this legend, he might have heard a different
version of Williams&rsquo;s tale, and that too of equal value with
Williams&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Possibly, there were not more than from forty to
fifty years between the time when the older writer heard the tale and the
time when it was heard by the younger man.&nbsp; An octogenarian, or even a
younger person, could have conversed with both Williams and
<i>Glasynys</i>.&nbsp; <i>Glasynys&rsquo;s</i> tale appears in Professor
Rhys&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Fairy Tales</i>, <i>Cymmrodor</i>, vol. iv., p.
188.&nbsp; It originally appeared in the <i>Brython</i> for 1863, p.
193.&nbsp; It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One fine sunny morning, as the young heir of Ystrad was busied
with his sheep on the side of Moel Eilio, he met a very pretty girl, and
when he got home he told the folks there of it.&nbsp; A few days afterwards
he met her again, and this happened several times, when he mentioned it to
his father, who advised him to seize her when he next met her.&nbsp; The
next time he met her he proceeded to do so, but before he could take her
away, a little fat old man came to them and begged him to give her back to
him, to which the youth would not listen.&nbsp; The little man uttered
terrible threats, but he would not yield, so an agreement was made between
them that he was to have her to wife until he touched her skin with iron,
and great was the joy both of the son and his parents in consequence.&nbsp;
They lived together for many years, but once on a time, on the evening of
Bettws Fair, the wife&rsquo;s horse got restive, and somehow, as the
husband was attending to the horse, the stirrups touched the skin of her
bare leg, and that very night she was taken away from him.&nbsp; She had
three or four children, and more than one of their <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>descendants, as
<i>Glasynys</i> maintains, were known to him at the time he wrote in
1863.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp; <i>The Llanfrothen Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>I am indebted to the Rev. R. Jones, Rector of Llanycil, Bala, for the
following legend.&nbsp; I may state that Mr. Jones is a native of
Llanfrothen, Merionethshire, a parish in close proximity to the scene of
the story.&nbsp; Mr. Jones&rsquo;s informant was his mother, a lady whose
mind was well stored with tales of by-gone times, and my friend and
informant inherits his mother&rsquo;s retentive memory, as well as her love
of ancient lore.</p>
<p>A certain man fell in love with a beautiful Fairy lady, and he wished to
marry her.&nbsp; She consented to do so, but warned him that if he ever
touched her with iron she would leave him immediately.&nbsp; This
stipulation weighed but lightly on the lover.&nbsp; They were married, and
for many years they lived most happily together, and several children were
born to them.&nbsp; A sad mishap, however, one day overtook them.&nbsp;
They were together, crossing Traethmawr, Penrhyndeudraeth, on horseback,
when the man&rsquo;s horse became restive, and jerked his head towards the
woman, and the bit of the bridle touched the left arm of the Fairy
wife.&nbsp; She at once told her husband that they must part for
ever.&nbsp; He was greatly distressed, and implored her not to leave
him.&nbsp; She said she could not stay.&nbsp; Then the man, appealing to a
mother&rsquo;s love for her children, begged that she would for the sake of
their offspring continue to dwell with him and them, and, said he, what
will become of our children without their mother?&nbsp; Her answer
was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gadewch iddynt fod yn bennau cochion a thrwynau hirion.</p>
<p>Let them be redheaded and longnosed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Having uttered these words, she disappeared and was never seen
afterwards.</p>
<p>No Welsh Taboo story can be complete without the pretty tale of the Van
Lake Legend, or, as it is called, &ldquo;The Myddfai Legend.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Because of its intrinsic beauty and worth, and for the sake of comparison
with the preceding stories, I will relate this legend.&nbsp; There are
several versions extant.&nbsp; Mr. Wirt Sikes, in his <i>British
Goblins</i>, has one, the <i>Cambro-Briton</i> has one, but the best is
that recorded by Professor Rhys, in the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, vol. iv., p. 163,
in his <i>Welsh Fairy Tales</i>.&nbsp; There are other readings of the
legend to be met with.&nbsp; I will first of all give an epitome of the
Professor&rsquo;s version.</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>The Myddvai Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>A widow, who had an only son, was obliged, in consequence of the large
flocks she possessed, to send, under the care of her son, a portion of her
cattle to graze on the Black Mountain near a small lake called
Llyn-y-Van-Bach.</p>
<p>One day the son perceived, to his great astonishment, a most beautiful
creature with flowing hair sitting on the unruffled surface of the lake
combing her tresses, the water serving as a mirror.&nbsp; Suddenly she
beheld the young man standing on the brink of the lake with his eyes
rivetted on her, and unconsciously offering to herself the provision of
barley bread and cheese with which he had been provided when he left his
home.</p>
<p>Bewildered by a feeling of love and admiration for the object before
him, he continued to hold out his hand towards the lady, who imperceptibly
glided near to him, but gently refused the offer of his provisions.&nbsp;
He attempted to touch her, but she eluded his grasp, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cras dy fara;<br />
Nid hawdd fy nala.</p>
<p>Hard baked is thy bread;<br />
It is not easy to catch me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>She immediately dived under the water and disappeared, leaving the
love-stricken youth to return home a prey to disappointment and regret that
he had been unable to make further acquaintance with the lovely maiden with
whom he had desperately fallen in love.</p>
<p>On his return home he communicated to his mother the extraordinary
vision.&nbsp; She advised him to take some unbaked dough the next time in
his pocket, as there must have been some spell connected with the hard
baked bread, or &ldquo;Bara Cras,&rdquo; which prevented his catching the
lady.</p>
<p>Next morning, before the sun was up, the young man was at the lake, not
for the purpose of looking after the cattle, but that he might again
witness the enchanting vision of the previous day.&nbsp; In vain did he
glance over the surface of the lake; nothing met his view, save the ripples
occasioned by a stiff breeze, and a dark cloud hung heavily on the summit
of the Van.</p>
<p>Hours passed on, the wind was hushed, the overhanging clouds had
vanished, when the youth was startled by seeing some of his mother&rsquo;s
cattle on the precipitous side of the acclivity, nearly on the opposite
side of the lake.&nbsp; As he was hastening away to rescue them from their
perilous position, the object of his search again appeared to him, and
seemed much more beautiful than when he first beheld her.&nbsp; His hand
was again held out to her, full of unbaked bread, which he offered to her
with an urgent proffer of his heart also, and vows of eternal attachment,
all of which were refused by her, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llaith dy fara!<br />
Ti ni fynna.</p>
<p>Unbaked is thy bread!<br />
I will not have thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the smiles that played upon her features as the lady vanished
beneath the waters forbade him to despair, and <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>cheered him on his way
home.&nbsp; His aged parent was acquainted with his ill success, and she
suggested that his bread should the next time be but slightly baked, as
most likely to please the mysterious being.</p>
<p>Impelled by love, the youth left his mother&rsquo;s home early next
morning.&nbsp; He was soon near the margin of the lake impatiently awaiting
the reappearance of the lady.&nbsp; The sheep and goats browsed on the
precipitous sides of the Van, the cattle strayed amongst the rocks, rain
and sunshine came and passed away, unheeded by the youth who was wrapped up
in looking for the appearance of her who had stolen his heart.&nbsp; The
sun was verging towards the west, and the young man casting a sad look over
the waters ere departing homewards was astonished to see several cows
walking along its surface, and, what was more pleasing to his sight, the
maiden reappeared, even lovelier than ever.&nbsp; She approached the land
and he rushed to meet her in the water.&nbsp; A smile encouraged him to
seize her hand, and she accepted the moderately baked bread he offered her,
and after some persuasion she consented to become his wife, on condition
that they should live together until she received from him three blows
without a cause,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tri ergyd diachos,</p>
<p>Three causeless blows,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when, should he ever happen to strike her three such blows, she would
leave him for ever.&nbsp; These conditions were readily and joyfully
accepted.</p>
<p>Thus the Lady of the Lake became engaged to the young man, and having
loosed her hand for a moment she darted away and dived into the lake.&nbsp;
The grief of the lover at this disappearance of his affianced was such that
he determined to cast himself headlong into its unfathomed depths, and thus
end his life.&nbsp; As he was on the point of <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>committing this rash
act, there emerged out of the lake two most beautiful ladies, accompanied
by a hoary-headed man of noble mien and extraordinary stature, but having
otherwise all the force and strength of youth.&nbsp; This man addressed the
youth, saying that, as he proposed to marry one of his daughters, he
consented to the union, provided the young man could distinguish which of
the two ladies before him was the object of his affections.&nbsp; This was
no easy task, as the maidens were perfect counterparts of each other.</p>
<p>Whilst the young man narrowly scanned the two ladies and failed to
perceive the least difference betwixt the two, one of them thrust her foot
a slight degree forward.&nbsp; The motion, simple as it was, did not escape
the observation of the youth, and he discovered a trifling variation in the
mode in which their sandals were tied.&nbsp; This at once put an end to the
dilemma, for he had on previous occasions noticed the peculiarity of her
shoe-tie, and he boldly took hold of her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast chosen rightly,&rdquo; said the Father, &ldquo;be to
her a kind and faithful husband, and I will give her, as a dowry, as many
sheep, cattle, goats, and horses, as she can count of each without heaving
or drawing in her breath.&nbsp; But remember, that if you prove unkind to
her at any time and strike her three times without a cause, she shall
return to me, and shall bring all her stock with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the marriage settlement, to which the young man gladly
assented, and the bride was desired to count the number of sheep she was to
have.&nbsp; She immediately adopted the mode of counting by fives,
thus:&mdash;One, two, three, four, five,&mdash;one, two, three, four, five;
as many times as possible in rapid succession, till her breath was
exhausted.&nbsp; The same process of reckoning had to determine the number
of goats, cattle, and horses, respectively; and in an <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>instant the full number
of each came out of the lake, when called upon by the Father.</p>
<p>The young couple were then married, and went to reside at a farm called
Esgair Llaethdy, near Myddvai, where they lived in prosperity and happiness
for several years, and became the parents of three beautiful sons.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a christening in the neighbourhood to which
the parents were invited.&nbsp; When the day arrived the wife appeared
reluctant to attend the christening, alleging that the distance was too
great for her to walk.&nbsp; Her husband told her to fetch one of the
horses from the field.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you
will bring me my gloves which I left in our house.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went for
the gloves, and finding she had not gone for the horse, he playfully
slapped her shoulder with one of them, saying &ldquo;<i>d&ocirc;s</i>,
<i>d&ocirc;s</i>, go, go,&rdquo; when she reminded him of the terms on
which she consented to marry him, and warned him to be more cautious in the
future, as he had now given her one causeless blow.</p>
<p>On another occasion when they were together at a wedding and the
assembled guests were greatly enjoying themselves the wife burst into tears
and sobbed most piteously.&nbsp; Her husband touched her on the shoulder
and inquired the cause of her weeping; she said, &ldquo;Now people are
entering into trouble, and your troubles are likely to commence, as you
have the <i>second</i> time stricken me without a cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years passed on, and their children had grown up, and were particularly
clever young men.&nbsp; Amidst so many worldly blessings the husband almost
forgot that only <i>one</i> causeless blow would destroy his
prosperity.&nbsp; Still he was watchful lest any trivial occurrence should
take place which his wife must regard as a breach of their marriage
contract.&nbsp; She told him that her affection for him was unabated, and
warned him to be careful lest through inadvertence he might <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>give the last
and only blow which, by an unalterable destiny, over which she had no
control, would separate them for ever.</p>
<p>One day it happened that they went to a funeral together, where, in the
midst of mourning and grief at the house of the deceased, she appeared in
the gayest of spirits, and indulged in inconsiderate fits of laughter,
which so shocked her husband that he touched her, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Hush!
hush! don&rsquo;t laugh.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said that she laughed because
people when they die go out of trouble, and rising up, she went out of the
house, saying, &ldquo;The last blow has been struck, our marriage contract
is broken, and at an end.&nbsp; Farewell!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she started off
towards Esgair Llaethdy, where she called her cattle and other stock
together, each by name, not forgetting, the &ldquo;little black calf&rdquo;
which had been slaughtered and was suspended on the hook, and away went the
calf and all the stock, with the Lady across Myddvai Mountain, and
disappeared beneath the waters of the lake whence the Lady had come.&nbsp;
The four oxen that were ploughing departed, drawing after them the plough,
which made a furrow in the ground, and which remains as a testimony of the
truth of this story.</p>
<p>She is said to have appeared to her sons, and accosting Rhiwallon, her
firstborn, to have informed him that he was to be a benefactor to mankind,
through healing all manner of their diseases, and she furnished him with
prescriptions and instructions for the preservation of health.&nbsp; Then,
promising to meet him when her counsel was most needed, she vanished.&nbsp;
On several other occasions she met her sons, and pointed out to them plants
and herbs, and revealed to them their medicinal qualities or virtues.</p>
<p>So ends the Myddvai Legend.</p>
<p>A variant of this tale appears in the form of a letter in the
<i>Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. ii, pp. 313-315.&nbsp; The editor <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>prefaces the
legend with the remark that the tale &ldquo;acquires an additional interest
from its resemblance in one particular to a similar tradition current in
Scotland, wherein certain beasts, brought from a lake, as in this tale,
play much the same part as is here described.&rdquo;&nbsp; The volume of
the <i>Cambro-Briton</i> now referred to was published in 1821 and
apparently the writer, who calls himself <i>Siencyn ab Tydvil</i>,
communicates an unwritten tradition afloat in Carmarthenshire, for he does
not tell us whence he obtained the story.&nbsp; As the tale differs in some
particulars from that already given, I will transcribe it.</p>
<h4>5.&nbsp; <i>The Cambro-Briton version of the Myddvai Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;A man, who lived in the farm-house called Esgair-llaethdy, in the
parish of Myddvai, in Carmarthenshire, having bought some lambs in a
neighbouring fair, led them to graze near <i>Llyn y Van Vach</i>, on the
Black Mountains.&nbsp; Whenever he visited the lambs, three most beautiful
female figures presented themselves to him from the lake, and often made
excursions on the boundaries of it.&nbsp; For some time he pursued and
endeavoured to catch them, but always failed; for the enchanting nymphs ran
before him, and, when they had reached the lake, they tauntingly
exclaimed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cras dy fara,<br />
Anhawdd ein dala,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which, with a little circumlocution, means, &lsquo;For thee, who eatest
baked bread, it is difficult to catch us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day some moist bread from the lake came to shore.&nbsp; The farmer
devoured it with great avidity, and on the following day he was successful
in his pursuit and caught the fair damsels.&nbsp; After a little
conversation with them, he commanded courage sufficient to make proposals
of marriage to one of them.&nbsp; She consented to accept them on the
condition that he would distinguish her from her two sisters <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>on the
following day.&nbsp; This was a new, and a very great difficulty to the
young farmer, for the fair nymphs were so similar in form and features,
that he could scarcely perceive any difference between them.&nbsp; He
observed, however, a trifling singularity in the strapping of her sandal,
by which he recognized her the following day.&nbsp; Some, indeed, who
relate this legend, say that this Lady of the Lake hinted in a private
conversation with her swain that upon the day of trial she would place
herself between her two sisters, and that she would turn her right foot a
little to the right, and that by this means he distinguished her from her
sisters.&nbsp; Whatever were the means, the end was secured; he selected
her, and she immediately left the lake and accompanied him to his
farm.&nbsp; Before she quitted, she summoned to attend her from the lake
seven cows, two oxen, and one bull.</p>
<p>This lady engaged to live with him until such time as he would strike
her three times without cause.&nbsp; For some years they lived together in
comfort, and she bore him three sons, who were the celebrated Meddygon
Myddvai.</p>
<p>One day, when preparing for a fair in the neighbourhood, he desired her
to go to the field for his horse.&nbsp; She said she would; but being
rather dilatory, he said to her humorously, &lsquo;<i>d&ocirc;s</i>,
<i>d&ocirc;s</i>, <i>d&ocirc;s</i>,&rsquo; i.e., &lsquo;go, go, go,&rsquo;
and he slightly touched her arm <i>three times</i> with his glove.</p>
<p>As she now deemed the terms of her marriage broken, she immediately
departed, and summoned with her her seven cows, her two oxen, and the
bull.&nbsp; The oxen were at that very time ploughing in the field, but
they immediately obeyed her call, and took the plough with them.&nbsp; The
furrow from the field in which they were ploughing, to the margin of the
lake, is to be seen in several parts of that country to the present
day.</p>
<p>After her departure, she once met her two sons in a Cwm, <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>now called
<i>Cwm Meddygon</i> (Physicians&rsquo; Combe), and delivered to each of
them a bag containing some articles which are unknown, but which are
supposed to have been some discoveries in medicine.</p>
<p>The Meddygon Myddvai were Rhiwallon and his sons, Cadwgan, Gruffydd, and
Einion.&nbsp; They were the chief physicians of their age, and they wrote
about A.D. 1230.&nbsp; A copy of their works is in the Welsh School
Library, in Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such are the Welsh Taboo tales.&nbsp; I will now make a few remarks upon
them.</p>
<p>The <i>age</i> of these legends is worthy of consideration.&nbsp; The
legend of <i>Meddygon Myddvai</i> dates from about the thirteenth
century.&nbsp; Rhiwallon and his sons, we are told by the writer in the
<i>Cambro-Briton</i>, wrote about 1230 A.D., but the editor of that
publication speaks of a manuscript written by these physicians about the
year 1300.&nbsp; Modern experts think that their treatise on medicine in
the <i>Red Book of Hergest</i> belongs to the end of the fourteenth
century, about 1380 to 1400.</p>
<p><i>Dafydd ab Gwilym</i>, who is said to have flourished in the
fourteenth century, says, in one of his poems, as given in the
<i>Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. ii., p. 313, alluding to these
physicians:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Meddyg, nis gwnai modd y gwnaeth<br />
Myddfai, o chai ddyn meddfaeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Physician he would not make<br />
As Myddvai made, if he had a mead fostered man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear, therefore, that these celebrated physicians lived
somewhere about the thirteenth century.&nbsp; They are described as
Physicians of Rhys Gryg, a prince of South Wales, who lived in the early
part of the thirteenth century.&nbsp; Their supposed supernatural origin
dates therefore from the thirteenth, or at the latest, the fourteenth
century.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>I
have mentioned <i>Y Gwylliaid Cochion</i>, or, as they are generally
styled, <i>Gwylliaid Cochion Mawddwy</i>, the Red Fairies of Mawddwy, as
being of Fairy origin.&nbsp; The Llanfrothen Legend seems to account for a
race of men in Wales differing from their neighbours in certain
features.&nbsp; The offspring of the Fairy union were, according to the
Fairy mother&rsquo;s prediction in that legend, to have red hair and
prominent noses.&nbsp; That a race of men having these characteristics did
exist in Wales is undoubted.&nbsp; They were a strong tribe, the men were
tall and athletic, and lived by plunder.&nbsp; They had their head quarters
at Dinas Mawddwy, Merionethshire, and taxed their neighbours in open day,
driving away sheep and cattle to their dens.&nbsp; So unbearable did their
depredations become that John Wynn ap Meredydd of Gwydir and Lewis Owen, or
as he is called Baron Owen, raised a body of stout men to overcome them,
and on Christmas Eve, 1554, succeeded in capturing a large number of the
offenders, and, there and then, some hundred or so of the robbers were
hung.&nbsp; Tradition says that a mother begged hard for the life of a
young son, who was to be destroyed, but Baron Owen would not relent.&nbsp;
On perceiving that her request was unheeded, baring her breast she
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Y bronau melynion hyn a fagasant y rhai a ddialant waed fy mab, ac a
olchant eu dwylaw yn ngwaed calon llofrudd eu brawd.</p>
<p>These yellow breasts have nursed those who will revenge my son&rsquo;s
blood, and will wash their hands in the heart&rsquo;s blood of the murderer
of their brother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <i>Pennant</i> this threat was carried out by the murder of
Baron Owen in 1555, when he was passing through the thick woods of Mawddwy
on his way to Montgomeryshire Assizes, at a place called to this day
<i>Llidiart y Barwn</i>, the Baron&rsquo;s Gate, from the deed.&nbsp;
Tradition further tells us that the murderers had gone a distance off
before they <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>remembered their mother&rsquo;s threat, and returning thrust their
swords into the Baron&rsquo;s breast, and washed their hands in his
heart&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; This act was followed by vigorous action, and
the banditti were extirpated, the females only remaining, and the
descendants of these women are occasionally still to be met with in
Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire.</p>
<p>For the preceding information the writer is indebted to <i>Yr Hynafion
Cymreig</i>, pp. 91-94, <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i>, for 1854, pp.
119-20, <i>Pennant</i>, vol. ii, pp. 225-27, ed. Carnarvon, and the
tradition was told him by the Revd. D. James, Vicar of Garthbeibio, who
likewise pointed out to him the very spot where the Baron was murdered.</p>
<p>But now, who were these <i>Gwylliaid</i>?&nbsp; According to the hint
conveyed by their name they were of Fairy parentage, an idea which a writer
in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i>, vol. v., 1854, p. 119,
intended, perhaps, to throw out.&nbsp; But according to <i>Brut y
Tywysogion</i>, <i>Myf. Arch</i>., p. 706, A.D. 1114, Denbigh edition, the
<i>Gwylliaid Cochion Mawddwy</i> began in the time of Cadwgan ab Bleddyn ab
Cynvyn.</p>
<p>From Williams&rsquo;s <i>Eminent Welshmen</i>, we gather that Prince
Cadwgan died in 1110, A.D., and, according to the above-mentioned
<i>Brut</i>, it was in his days that the Gwylliaid commenced their career,
if not their existence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for this beginning of the red-headed banditti of Mawddwy,
Tacitus states in his Life of Agricola, ch. xi., that there were in Britain
men with red hair who he surmises were of German extraction.&nbsp; We must,
therefore, look for the commencement of a people of this description long
before the twelfth century, and the Llanfrothen legend either dates from
remote antiquity, or it was a tale that found in its wanderings a resting
place in that locality in ages long past.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>From a legend recorded by <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>, which shall
by and by be given, it would seem that a priest named Elidorus lived among
the Fairies in their home in the bowels of the earth, and this would be in
the early part of the twelfth century.&nbsp; The question arises, is the
priest&rsquo;s tale credible, or did he merely relate a story of himself
which had been ascribed to some one else in the traditions of the
people?&nbsp; If his tale is true, then, there lived even in that late
period a remnant of the aborigines of the country, who had their homes in
caves.&nbsp; The Myddvai Legend in part corroborates this supposition, for
that story apparently belongs to the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>It is difficult to fix the date of the other legends here given, for
they are dressed in modern garbs, with, however, trappings of remote
times.&nbsp; Probably all these tales have reached, through oral tradition,
historic times, but in reality they belong to that far-off distant period,
when the prehistoric inhabitants of this island dwelt in Lake-habitations,
or in caves.&nbsp; And the marriage of Fairy ladies, with men of a
different race, intimates that the more ancient people were not extirpated,
but were amalgamated with their conquerors.</p>
<p>Many Fairy tales in Wales are associated with lakes.&nbsp; Fairy ladies
emerge from lakes and disappear into lakes.&nbsp; In the oriental legend
Pur&ucirc;ravas came upon his absconding wife in a lake.&nbsp; In many
Fairy stories lakes seem to be the entrance to the abodes of the
Fairies.&nbsp; Evidently, therefore, those people were lake-dwellers.&nbsp;
In the lakes of Switzerland and other countries have been discovered
vestiges of Lake-villages belonging to the Stone Age, and even to the
Bronze Age.&nbsp; Perhaps those that belong to the Stone Age are the most
ancient kind of human abodes still traceable in the world.&nbsp; In Ireland
and Scotland these kinds of dwellings have been found.&nbsp; I am not in a
position to say that they <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>have been discovered in Wales; but some thirty
years ago Mr. Colliver, a Cornish gentleman, told the writer that whilst
engaged in mining operations near Llyn Llydaw he had occasion to lower the
water level of that lake, when he discovered embedded in the mud a canoe
formed out of the trunk of a single tree.&nbsp; He saw another in the lake,
but this he did not disturb, and there it is at the present day.&nbsp; The
late Professor Peter of Bala believed that he found traces of
Lake-dwellings in Bala Lake, and the people in those parts have a tradition
that a town lies buried beneath its waters&mdash;a tradition, indeed,
common to many lakes.&nbsp; It is not therefore unlikely that if the lakes
of Wales are explored they will yield evidences of lake-dwellers, and,
however unromantic it may appear, the Lady of the Van Lake was only
possibly a maiden snatched from her watery home by a member of a stronger
race.</p>
<p>In these legends the lady does not seem to evince much love for her
husband after she has left him.&nbsp; Possibly he did not deserve much, but
towards her children she shows deep affection.&nbsp; After the husband is
deserted, the children are objects of her solicitation, and they are
visited.&nbsp; The Lady of the Van Lake promised to meet her son whenever
her counsel or aid was required.&nbsp; A like trait belongs to the Homeric
goddesses.&nbsp; Thetis heard from her father&rsquo;s court far away
beneath the ocean the terrible sounds of grief that burst from her son
Achilles on hearing of the death of his dear friend Patroclus, and quickly
ascended to earth all weeping to learn what ailed her son.&nbsp; These
Fairy ladies also show a mother&rsquo;s love, immortal though they be.</p>
<p>The children of these marriages depart not with their mother, they
remain with the father, but she takes with her her dowry.&nbsp; Thus there
are many descendants of the Lady of the Van Lake still living in South
Wales, and as <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Professor Rhys remarks&mdash;&ldquo;This brings the legend of the
Lady of the Van Lake into connection with a widely spread family;&rdquo;
and, it may be added, shows that the Celts on their advent to Wales found
it inhabited by a race with whom they contracted marriages.</p>
<p>The manner in which the lady is seized when dancing in the Ystrad Legend
calls to mind the strategy of the tribe of Benjamin to secure wives for
themselves of the daughters of Shiloh according to the advice of the elders
who commanded them,&mdash;&ldquo;Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; and
see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances,
then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you everyone his wife of the
daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin,&rdquo; Judges, ch.
xxi.&nbsp; The rape of the Sabine women, who were seized by the followers
of Romulus on a day appointed for sacrifice and public games, also serves
as a precedent for the action of those young Welshmen who captured Fairy
wives whilst enjoying themselves in the dance.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact, that a singular testimony to wife snatching in
ancient times is indicated by a custom once general, and still not obsolete
in South Wales, of a feigned attempt on the part of the friends of the
young woman about to get married to hinder her from carrying out her
object.&nbsp; The Rev. Griffith Jones, Vicar of Mostyn, informed the writer
that he had witnessed such a struggle.&nbsp; The wedding, he stated, took
place at Tregaron, Cardiganshire.&nbsp; The friends of both the young
people were on horseback, and according to custom they presented themselves
at the house of the young woman, the one to escort her to the church, and
the other to hinder her from going there.&nbsp; The friends of the young
man were called &ldquo;<i>Gwyr shegouts</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the young
lady was mounted, she was surrounded by <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the <i>gwyr
shegouts</i>, and the cavalcade started.&nbsp; All went on peaceably until
a lane was reached, down which the lady bolted, and here the struggle
commenced, for her friends dashed between her and her husband&rsquo;s
friends and endeavoured to force them back, and thus assist her to
escape.&nbsp; The parties, Mr. Jones said, rode furiously and madly, and
the struggle presented a cavalry charge, and it was not without much
apparent danger that the opposition was overcome, and the lady ultimately
forced to proceed to the church, where her future husband was anxiously
awaiting her arrival.&nbsp; This strange custom of ancient times and
obscure origin is suggestive of the way in which the stronger party
procured wives in days of old.</p>
<p>Before the marriage of the Fairy lady to the mortal takes place, the
father of the lady appears on the scene, sometimes as a supplicant, and at
others as a consenting party to the inevitable marriage, but never is he
depicted as resorting to force to rescue his daughter.&nbsp; This
pusillanimity can only be reasonably accounted for by supposing that the
&ldquo;little man&rdquo; was physically incapable of encountering and
overcoming by brute force the aspirant to the hand of his daughter.&nbsp;
From this conduct we must, I think, infer that the Fairy race were a weak
people bodily, unaccustomed and disinclined to war.&nbsp; Their safety and
existence consisted in living in the inaccessible parts of the mountains,
or in lake dwellings far removed from the habitations of the stronger and
better equipped race that had invaded their country.&nbsp; In this way they
could, and very likely did, occupy parts of Wales contemporaneously with
their conquerors, who, through marriage, became connected with the mild
race, whom they found in possession of the land.</p>
<p>In the Welsh legends the maid consents to wed her capturer, and remain
with him until he strikes her with <i>iron</i>.&nbsp; <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>In every instance where
this stipulation is made, it is ultimately broken, and the wife departs
never to return.&nbsp; It has been thought that this implies that the
people who immediately succeeded the Fair race belonged to the Iron Age,
whilst the fair aborigines belonged to the Stone or Bronze age, and that
they were overcome by the superior arms of their opponents, quite as much
as by their greater bodily strength.&nbsp; Had the tabooed article been in
every instance <i>iron</i>, the preceding supposition would have carried
with it considerable weight, but as this is not the case, all that can be
said positively is, that the conquerors of the Fair race were certainly
acquainted with iron, and the blow with iron that brought about the
catastrophe was undoubtedly inflicted by the mortal who had married the
Fairy lady.&nbsp; Why iron should have been tabooed by the Fairy and her
father, must remain an open question.&nbsp; But if we could, with reason,
suppose, that that metal had brought about their subjugation, then in an
age of primitive and imperfect knowledge, and consequent deep superstition,
we might not be wrong in supposing that the subjugated race would look upon
iron with superstitious dread, and ascribe to it supernatural power
inimical to them as a race.&nbsp; They would under such feelings have
nothing whatever to do with iron, just as the benighted African, witnessing
for the first time the effects of a gun shot, would, with dread, avoid a
gun.&nbsp; By this process of reasoning we arrive at the conclusion that
the Fairy race belonged to a period anterior to the Iron Age.</p>
<p>With one remark, I will bring my reflections on the preceding legends to
an end.&nbsp; Polygamy apparently was unknown in the distant times we are
considering.&nbsp; But the marriage bond was not indissoluble, and the
initiative in the separation was taken by the woman.</p>
<h3><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>MEN CAPTURED BY FAIRIES.</h3>
<p>In the preceding legends, we have accounts of men capturing female
Fairies, and marrying them.&nbsp; It would be strange if the kidnapping
were confined to one of the two races, but Folk-Lore tells us that the Fair
Family were not innocent of actions similar to those of mortals, for many a
man was snatched away by them, and carried off to their subterranean
abodes, who, in course of time, married the fair daughters of the
<i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>.&nbsp; Men captured Fairy ladies, but the Fairies
captured handsome men.</p>
<p>The oldest written legend of this class is to be found in the pages of
<i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>, pp. 390-92, Bohn&rsquo;s edition.&nbsp; The
Archdeacon made the tour of Wales in 1188; the legend therefore which he
records can boast of a good old age, but the tale itself is older than
<i>The Itinerary through Wales</i>, for the writer informs us that the
priest Elidorus, who affirmed that he had been in the country of the
Fairies, talked in his old age to David II., bishop of St. David, of the
event.&nbsp; Now David II. was promoted to the see of St. David in 1147,
or, according to others, in 1149, and died A.D. 1176; therefore the legend
had its origin before the last-mentioned date, and, if the priest were a
very old man when he died, his tale would belong to the eleventh
century.</p>
<p>With these prefatory remarks, I will give the legend as recorded by
Giraldus.</p>
<h4>1.&nbsp; <i>Elidorus and the Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;A short time before our days, a circumstance worthy of note
occurred in these parts, which Elidorus, a priest, most strenuously
affirmed had befallen to himself.</p>
<p>When a youth of twelve years, and learning his letters, since, as
Solomon says, &lsquo;The root of learning is bitter, although the fruit is
sweet,&rsquo; in order to avoid the discipline <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and frequent stripes
inflicted on him by his preceptor, he ran away and concealed himself under
the hollow bank of the river.&nbsp; After fasting in that situation for two
days, two little men of pigmy stature appeared to him, saying, &lsquo;If
you will come with us, we will lead you into a country full of delights and
sports.&rsquo;&nbsp; Assenting and rising up, he followed his guides
through a path, at first subterraneous and dark, into a most beautiful
country, adorned with rivers and meadows, woods and plains, but obscure,
and not illuminated with the full light of the sun.&nbsp; All the days were
cloudy, and the nights extremely dark, on account of the absence of the
moon and stars.&nbsp; The boy was brought before the King, and introduced
to him in the presence of the court; who, having examined him for a long
time, delivered him to his son, who was then a boy.&nbsp; These men were of
the smallest stature, but very well proportioned in their make; they were
all of a fair complexion, with luxuriant hair falling over their shoulders
like that of women.&nbsp; They had horses and greyhounds adapted to their
size.&nbsp; They neither ate flesh nor fish, but lived on milk diet, made
up into messes with saffron.&nbsp; They never took an oath, for they
detested nothing so much as lies.&nbsp; As often as they returned from our
upper hemisphere, they reprobated our ambition, infidelities, and
inconstancies; they had no form of public worship, being strict lovers and
reverers, as it seemed, of truth.</p>
<p>The boy frequently returned to our hemisphere, sometimes by the way he
had first gone, sometimes by another; at first in company with other
persons, and afterwards alone, and made himself known only to his mother,
declaring to her the manners, nature, and state of that people.&nbsp; Being
desired by her to bring a present of gold, with which that region abounded,
he stole, while at play with the king&rsquo;s <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>son, the golden ball
with which he used to divert himself, and brought it to his mother in great
haste; and when he reached the door of his father&rsquo;s house, but not
unpursued, and was entering it in a great hurry, his foot stumbled on the
threshold, and falling down into the room where his mother was sitting, the
two pigmies seized the ball which had dropped from his hand and departed,
showing the boy every mark of contempt and derision.&nbsp; On recovering
from his fall, confounded with shame, and execrating the evil counsel of
his mother, he returned by the usual track to the subterraneous road, but
found no appearance of any passage, though he searched for it on the banks
of the river for nearly the space of a year.&nbsp; But since those
calamities are often alleviated by time, which reason cannot mitigate, and
length of time alone blunts the edge of our afflictions and puts an end to
many evils, the youth, having been brought back by his friends and mother,
and restored to his right way of thinking, and to his learning, in process
of time attained the rank of priesthood.</p>
<p>Whenever David II., Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, talked to him in his
advanced state of life concerning this event, he could never relate the
particulars without shedding tears.&nbsp; He had made himself acquainted
with the language of that nation, the words of which, in his younger days,
he used to recite, which, as the bishop often had informed me, were very
conformable to the Greek idiom.&nbsp; When they asked for water, they said
&lsquo;Ydor ydorum,&rsquo; which meant &lsquo;Bring water,&rsquo; for Ydor
in their language, as well as in the Greek, signifies water, whence vessels
for water are called &Atilde;driai; and Dwr, also in the British language
signifies water.&nbsp; When they wanted salt they said &lsquo;Halgein
ydorum,&rsquo; &lsquo;Bring salt.&rsquo;&nbsp; Salt is called al in Greek,
and Halen in British, for that language, from the length of time which the
Britons (then called Trojans and <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>afterwards Britons, from Brito, their leader)
remained in Greece after the destruction of Troy, became, in many
instances, similar to the Greek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This legend agrees in a remarkable degree with the popular opinion
respecting Fairies.&nbsp; It would almost appear to be the foundation of
many subsequent tales that are current in Wales.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s testimony to Fairy temperance and love of truth, and
their reprobation of ambition, infidelities, and inconstancies,
notwithstanding that they had no form of public worship, and their
abhorrence of theft intimate that they possessed virtues worthy of all
praise.</p>
<p>Their abode is altogether mysterious, but this ancient description of
Fairyland bears out the remarks&mdash;perhaps suggested the remarks, of the
Rev. Peter Roberts in his book called <i>The Cambrian Popular
Antiquities</i>.&nbsp; In this work, the author promulgates the theory that
the Fairies were a people existing distinct from the known inhabitants of
the country and confederated together, and met mysteriously to avoid coming
in contact with the stronger race that had taken possession of their land,
and he supposes that in these traditionary tales of the Fairies we
recognize something of the real history of an ancient people whose customs
were those of a regular and consistent policy.&nbsp; Roberts supposes that
the smaller race for the purpose of replenishing their ranks stole the
children of their conquerors, or slyly exchanged their weak children for
their enemies&rsquo; strong children.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the people among whom Elidorus sojourned had a
language cognate with the Irish, Welsh, Greek, and other tongues; in fact,
it was similar to that language which at one time extended, with
dialectical differences, from Ireland to India; and the <i>Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i>, in <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>our legends, are described as speaking a
language understood by those with whom they conversed.&nbsp; This language
they either acquired from their conquerors, or both races must have had a
common origin; the latter, probably, being the more reasonable supposition,
and by inference, therefore, the Fairies and other nations by whom they
were subdued were descended from a common stock, and ages afterwards, by
marriage, the Fairies again commingled with other branches of the family
from which they had originally sprung.</p>
<p>Omitting many embellishments which the imagination has no difficulty in
bestowing, tradition has transmitted one fact, that the <i>Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i> succeeded in inducing men through the allurements of music
and the attractions of their fair daughters to join their ranks.&nbsp; I
will now give instances of this belief.</p>
<p>The following tale I received from the mouth of Mr. Richard Jones,
Ty&rsquo;n-y-wern, Bryneglwys, near Corwen.&nbsp; Mr. Jones has stored up
in his memory many tales of olden times, and he even thinks that he has
himself seen a Fairy.&nbsp; Standing by his farm, he pointed out to me on
the opposite side of the valley a Fairy ring still green, where once, he
said, the Fairies held their nightly revels.&nbsp; The scene of the tale
which Mr. Jones related is wild, and a few years ago it was much more so
than at present.&nbsp; At the time that the event is said to have taken
place the mountain was unenclosed, and there was not much travelling in
those days, and consequently the Fairies could, undisturbed, enjoy their
dances.&nbsp; But to proceed with the tale.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; <i>A Bryneglwys Man inveigled by the Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>Two waggoners were sent from Bryneglwys for coals to the works over the
hill beyond Minera.&nbsp; On their way they came upon a company of Fairies
dancing with all their might.&nbsp; The men stopped to witness their
movements, and <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>the Fairies invited them to join in the dance.&nbsp; One of the
men stoutly refused to do so, but the other was induced to dance awhile
with them.&nbsp; His companion looked on for a short time at the antics of
his friend, and then shouted out that he would wait no longer, and desired
the man to give up and come away.&nbsp; He, however, turned a deaf ear to
the request, and no words could induce him to forego his dance.&nbsp; At
last his companion said that he was going, and requested his friend to
follow him.&nbsp; Taking the two waggons under his care he proceeded
towards the coal pits, expecting every moment to be overtaken by his
friend; but he was disappointed, for he never appeared.&nbsp; The waggons
and their loads were taken to Bryneglwys, and the man thought that perhaps
his companion, having stopped too long in the dance, had turned homewards
instead of following him to the coal pit.&nbsp; But on enquiry no one had
heard or seen the missing waggoner.&nbsp; One day his companion met a Fairy
on the mountain and inquired after his missing friend.&nbsp; The Fairy told
him to go to a certain place, which he named, at a certain time, and that
he should there see his friend.&nbsp; The man went, and there saw his
companion just as he had left him, and the first words that he uttered were
&ldquo;Have the waggons gone far.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor man never dreamt
that months and months had passed away since they had started together for
coal.</p>
<p>A variant of the preceding story appears in the <i>Cambrian
Magazine</i>, vol. ii., pp. 58-59, where it is styled the Year&rsquo;s
Sleep, or &ldquo;The Forest of the Yewtree,&rdquo; but for the sake of
association with like tales I will call it by the following
title:&mdash;</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp; <i>Story of a man who spent twelve months in
Fairyland</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;In Mathavarn, in the parish of Llanwrin, and the Cantrev of
Cyveilioc, there is a wood which is called <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span><i>Ffridd yr Ywen</i>
(the Forest of the Yew); it is supposed to be so called because there is a
yew tree growing in the very middle of it.&nbsp; In many parts of the wood
are to be seen green circles, which are called &lsquo;the dancing places of
the goblins,&rsquo; about which, a considerable time ago, the following
tale was very common in the neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>
<p>Two servants of John Pugh, Esq., went out one day to work in the
&lsquo;Forest of the Yew.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pretty early in the afternoon the
whole country was so covered with dark vapour, that the youths thought
night was coming on; but when they came to the middle of the
&lsquo;Forest&rsquo; it brightened up around them and the darkness seemed
all left behind; so, thinking it too early to return home for the night,
they lay down and slept.&nbsp; One of them, on waking, was much surprised
to find no one there but himself; he wondered a good deal at the behaviour
of his companion, but made up his mind at last that he had gone on some
business of his own, as he had been talking of it some time before; so the
sleeper went home, and when they inquired after his companion, he told them
he was gone to the cobbler&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; The next day they inquired
of him again about his fellow-servant, but he could not give them any
account of him; but at last confessed how and where they had both gone to
sleep.&nbsp; Alter searching and searching many days, he went to a
&lsquo;<i>gwr cyvarwydd</i>&rsquo; (a conjuror), which was a very common
trade in those days, according to the legend; and the conjuror said to him,
&lsquo;Go to the same place where you and the lad slept; go there exactly a
year after the boy was lost; let it be on the same day of the year, and at
the same time of the day, but take care that you do not step inside the
Fairy ring, stand on the border of the green circles you saw there, and the
boy will come out with many of the goblins to dance, and when you see him
so near to you that <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>you may take hold of him, snatch him out of the
ring as quickly as you can.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did according to this advice,
and plucked the boy out, and then asked him, &lsquo;if he did not feel
hungry,&rsquo; to which he answered &lsquo;No,&rsquo; for he had still the
remains of his dinner that he had left in his wallet before going to sleep,
and he asked &lsquo;if it was not nearly night, and time to go home,&rsquo;
not knowing that a year had passed by.&nbsp; His look was like a skeleton,
and as soon as he had tasted food he was a dead man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A story in its main features similar to that recorded in the <i>Cambrian
Magazine</i> was related to me by my friend, the Rev. R. Jones, Rector of
Llanycil.&nbsp; I do not think Mr. Jones gave me the locality where the
occurrence is said to have taken place; at least, if he did so, I took no
note of it.&nbsp; The story is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>A man who spent twelve months and a day with the
Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>A young man, a farm labourer, and his sweetheart were sauntering along
one evening in an unfrequented part of the mountain, when there appeared
suddenly before them two Fairies, who proceeded to make a circle.&nbsp;
This being done, a large company of Fairies accompanied by musicians
appeared, and commenced dancing over the ring; their motions and music were
entrancing, and the man, an expert dancer, by some irresistible power was
obliged to throw himself into the midst of the dancers and join them in
their gambols.&nbsp; The woman looked on enjoying the sight for several
hours, expecting every minute that her lover would give up the dance and
join her, but no, on and on went the dance, round and round went her lover,
until at last daylight appeared, and then suddenly the music ceased and the
Fairy band vanished; and with them her lover.&nbsp; In great <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>dismay, the
young woman shouted the name of her sweetheart, but all in vain, he came
not to her.&nbsp; The sun had now risen, and, almost broken-hearted, she
returned home and related the events of the previous night.&nbsp; She was
advised to consult a man who was an adept in the black art.&nbsp; She did
so, and the conjuror told her to go to the same place at the same time of
the night one year and one day from the time that her lover had disappeared
and that she should then and there see him.&nbsp; She was farther
instructed how to act.&nbsp; The conjuror warned her from going into the
ring, but told her to seize her lover by the arm as he danced round, and to
jerk him out of the enchanted circle.&nbsp; Twelve months and a day passed
away, and the faithful girl was on the spot where she lost her lover.&nbsp;
At the very moment that they had in the first instance appeared the Fairies
again came to view, and everything that she had witnessed previously was
repeated.&nbsp; With the Fairy band was her lover dancing merrily in their
midst.&nbsp; The young woman ran round and round the circle close to the
young man, carefully avoiding the circle, and at last she succeeded in
taking hold of him and desired him to come away with her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do let me alone a little longer, and then
I will come with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have already been long
enough,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; His answer was, &ldquo;It is so delightful,
let me dance on only a few minutes longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; She saw that he was
under a spell, and grasping the young man&rsquo;s arm with all her might
she followed him round and round the circle, and an opportunity offering
she jerked him out of the circle.&nbsp; He was greatly annoyed at her
conduct, and when told that he had been with the Fairies a year and a day
he would not believe her, and affirmed that he had been dancing only a few
minutes; however, he went away with the faithful girl, and when he had
reached the farm, his friends had the <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>greatest difficulty in
persuading him that he had been so long from home.</p>
<p>The next Fairy tale that I shall give akin to the preceding stories is
to be found in <i>Y Brython</i>, vol. iii., pp. 459-60.&nbsp; The writer of
the tale was the Rev. Benjamin Williams, whose bardic name was
Gwynionydd.&nbsp; I do not know the source whence Mr. Williams derived the
story, but most likely he obtained it from some aged person who firmly
believed that the tale was a true record of what actually occurred.&nbsp;
In the <i>Brython</i> the tale is called: &ldquo;Y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g a Mab
Llech y Derwydd,&rdquo; and this title I will retain, merely translating
it.&nbsp; The introduction, however, I will not give, as it does not
directly bear on the subject now under consideration.</p>
<h4>5.&nbsp; <i>The Son of Llech y Derwydd and the Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>The son of Llech y Derwydd was the only son of his parents and heir to
the farm.&nbsp; He was very dear to his father and mother, yea, he was as
the very light of their eyes.&nbsp; The son and the head servant man were
bosom friends, they were like two brothers, or rather twins.&nbsp; As they
were such close friends the farmer&rsquo;s wife was in the habit of
clothing them exactly alike.&nbsp; The two friends fell in love with two
young handsome women who were highly respected in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
This event gave the old people great satisfaction, and ere long the two
couples were joined in holy wedlock, and great was the merry-making on the
occasion.&nbsp; The servant man obtained a convenient place to live in on
the grounds of Llech y Derwydd.&nbsp; About six months after the marriage
of the son, he and the servant man went out to hunt.&nbsp; The servant
penetrated to a ravine filled with brushwood to look for game, and
presently returned to his friend, but by the time he came back the son was
nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; He continued awhile looking about <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>for his absent
friend, shouting and whistling to attract his attention, but there was no
answer to his calls.&nbsp; By and by he went home to Llech y Derwydd,
expecting to find him there, but no one knew anything about him.&nbsp;
Great was the grief of the family throughout the night, but it was even
greater the next day.&nbsp; They went to inspect the place where the son
had last been seen.&nbsp; His mother and his wife wept bitterly, but the
father had greater control over himself, still he appeared as half
mad.&nbsp; They inspected the place where the servant man had last seen his
friend, and, to their great surprise and sorrow, observed a Fairy ring
close by the spot, and the servant recollected that he had heard seductive
music somewhere about the time that he parted with his friend.&nbsp; They
came to the conclusion at once that the man had been so unfortunate as to
enter the Fairy ring, and they conjectured that he had been transported no
one knew where.&nbsp; Weary weeks and months passed away, and a son was
born to the absent man.&nbsp; The little one grew up the very image of his
father, and very precious was he to his grandfather and grandmother.&nbsp;
In fact, he was everything to them.&nbsp; He grew up to man&rsquo;s estate
and married a pretty girl in the neighbourhood, but her people had not the
reputation of being kind-hearted.&nbsp; The old folks died, and also their
daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>One windy afternoon in the month of October, the family of Llech y
Derwydd saw a tall thin old man with beard and hair as white as snow, who
they thought was a Jew, approaching slowly, very slowly, towards the
house.&nbsp; The servant girls stared mockingly through the window at him,
and their mistress laughed unfeelingly at the &ldquo;old Jew,&rdquo; and
lifted the children up, one after the other, to get a sight of him as he
neared the house.&nbsp; He came to the door, and entered the house boldly
enough, and inquired after his <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>parents.&nbsp; The mistress answered him in a
surly and unusually contemptuous manner, and wished to know &ldquo;What the
drunken old Jew wanted there,&rdquo; for they thought he must have been
drinking or he would never have spoken in the way he did.&nbsp; The old man
looked at everything in the house with surprise and bewilderment, but the
little children about the floor took his attention more than anything
else.&nbsp; His looks betrayed sorrow and deep disappointment.&nbsp; He
related his whole history, that, yesterday he had gone out to hunt, and
that he had now returned.&nbsp; The mistress told him that she had heard a
story about her husband&rsquo;s father, which occurred before she was born,
that he had been lost whilst hunting, but that her father had told her that
the story was not true, but that he had been killed.&nbsp; The woman became
uneasy and angry that the old &ldquo;Jew&rdquo; did not depart.&nbsp; The
old man was roused and said that the house was his, and that he would have
his rights.&nbsp; He went to inspect his possessions, and shortly
afterwards directed his steps to the servant&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; To his
surprise he saw that things there were greatly changed.&nbsp; After
conversing awhile with an aged man who sat by the fire, they carefully
looked each other in the face, and the old man by the fire related the sad
history of his lost friend, the son of Llech y Derwydd.&nbsp; They
conversed together deliberately on the events of their youth, but all
seemed like a dream.&nbsp; However, the old man in the corner came to the
conclusion that his visitor was his dear friend, the son of Llech y
Derwydd, returned from the land of the Fairies after having spent there
half a hundred years.&nbsp; The old man with the white beard believed the
story related by his friend, and long was the talk and many were the
questions which the one gave to the other.&nbsp; The visitor was informed
that the master of Llech y Derwydd was from home that day, and he was
persuaded to eat <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>some food; but, to the horror of all, when he
had done so, he instantly fell down dead.</p>
<p>Such is the story.&nbsp; The writer adds that the tale relates that the
cause of this man&rsquo;s sudden death was that he ate food after having
been so long in the land of the Fairies, and he further states that the
faithful old servant insisted on his dead friend&rsquo;s being buried with
his ancestors, and the rudeness of the mistress of Llech y Derwydd to her
father-in-law brought a curse upon the place and family, and her offence
was not expiated until the farm had been sold nine times.</p>
<p>The next tale that I shall relate is recorded by <i>Glasynys</i> in
<i>Cymru Fu</i>, pp. 177-179.&nbsp; Professor Rhys in his <i>Welsh Fairy
Tales</i>, <i>Y Cymmrodor</i>, vol. v., pp. 81-84, gives a translation of
this story.&nbsp; The Professor prefaces the tale with a caution that
<i>Glasynys</i> had elaborated the story, and that the proper names were
undoubtedly his own.&nbsp; The reverend author informs his readers that he
heard his mother relate the tale many times, but it certainly appears that
he has ornamented the simple narrative after his own fashion, for he was
professedly a believer in words; however, in its general outline, it bears
the impress of antiquity, and strongly resembles other Welsh Fairy
tales.&nbsp; It belongs to that species of Fairy stories which compose this
chapter, and therefore it is here given as translated by Professor
Rhys.&nbsp; I will for the sake of reference give the tale a name, and
describe it under the following heading.</p>
<h4>6.&nbsp; <i>A young man marries a Fairy Lady in Fairy Land, and brings
her to live with him among his own people</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Once on a time a shepherd boy had gone up the mountain.&nbsp;
That day, like many a day before and after, was exceedingly misty.&nbsp;
Now, though he was well acquainted with the place, he lost his way, and
walked backwards and forwards for many a long hour.&nbsp; At last he got
into a low <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>rushy spot, where he saw before him many circular rings.&nbsp; He
at once recalled the place, and began to fear the worst.&nbsp; He had
heard, many hundreds of times, of the bitter experiences in those rings of
many a shepherd who had happened to chance on the dancing-place or the
circles of the Fair Family.&nbsp; He hastened away as fast as ever he
could, lest he should be ruined like the rest; but though he exerted
himself to the point of perspiring, and losing his breath, there he was,
and there he continued to be, a long time.&nbsp; At last he was met by a
little fat old man with merry blue eyes, who asked him what he was
doing.&nbsp; He answered that he was trying to find his way homeward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;come after me, and do not utter a word
until I bid thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; This he did, following him on and on until
they came to an oval stone, and the little old fat man lifted it, after
tapping the middle of it three times with his walking stick.&nbsp; There
was there a narrow path with stairs to be seen here and there, and a sort
of whitish light, inclining to grey and blue, was to be seen radiating from
the stones.&nbsp; &lsquo;Follow me fearlessly,&rsquo; said the fat man,
&lsquo;no harm will be done thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; So on the poor youth went,
as reluctantly as a dog to be hanged; but presently a fine-wooded, fertile
country spread itself out before them, with well arranged mansions dotting
it over, while every kind of apparent magnificence met the eye, and seemed
to smile in its landscape; the bright waters of its rivers meandered in
twisted streams, and its hills were covered with the luxuriant verdure of
their grassy growth, and the mountains with a glossy fleece of smooth
pasture.&nbsp; By the time they had reached the stout gentleman&rsquo;s
mansion, the young man&rsquo;s senses had been bewildered by the sweet
cadence of the music which the birds poured forth from the groves, then
there was gold there to dazzle his eyes and silver flashing <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>on his
sight.&nbsp; He saw there all kinds of musical instruments and all sorts of
things for playing, but he could discern no inhabitant in the whole place;
and when he sat down to eat, the dishes on the table came to their places
of themselves and disappeared when one had done with them.&nbsp; This
puzzled him beyond measure; moreover, he heard people talking together
around him, but for the life of him he could see no one but his old
friend.&nbsp; At length the fat man said to him, &lsquo;Thou canst now talk
as much as it may please thee;&rsquo; but when he attempted to move his
tongue it would no more stir than if it had been a lump of ice, which
greatly frightened him.&nbsp; At this point, a fine old lady, with health
and benevolence beaming in her face, came to them and slightly smiled at
the shepherd.&nbsp; The mother was followed by her three daughters, who
were remarkably beautiful.&nbsp; They gazed with somewhat playful looks at
him, and at length began to talk to him, but his tongue would not
wag.&nbsp; Then one of the girls came to him, and, playing with his yellow
and curly locks, gave him a smart kiss on his ruddy lips.&nbsp; This
loosened the string that bound his tongue, and he began to talk freely and
eloquently.&nbsp; There he was, under the charm of that kiss, in the bliss
of happiness, and there he remained a year and a day without knowing that
he had passed more than a day among them, for he had got into a country
where there was no reckoning of time.&nbsp; But by and by he began to feel
somewhat of a longing to visit his old home, and asked the stout man if he
might go.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stay a little yet,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and thou
shalt go for a while.&rsquo;&nbsp; That passed, he stayed on; but Olwen,
for that was the name of the damsel that had kissed him, was very unwilling
that he should depart.&nbsp; She looked sad every time he talked of going
away, nor was he himself without feeling a sort of a cold thrill passing
through him <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>at the thought of leaving her.&nbsp; On condition, however, of
returning, he obtained leave to go, provided with plenty of gold and
silver, of trinkets and gems.&nbsp; When he reached home, nobody knew who
he was; it had been the belief that he had been killed by another shepherd,
who found it necessary to betake himself hastily far away to America, lest
he should be hanged without delay.&nbsp; But here is Einion Las at home,
and everybody wonders especially to see that the shepherd had got to look
like a wealthy man; his manners, his dress, his language, and the treasure
he had with him, all conspired to give him the air of a gentleman.&nbsp; He
went back one Thursday night, the first of the moon that month, as suddenly
as he had left the first time, and nobody knew whither.&nbsp; There was
great joy in the country below when Einion returned thither, and nobody was
more rejoiced at it than Olwen, his beloved.&nbsp; The two were right
impatient to get married, but it was necessary to do that quietly, for the
family below hated nothing more than fuss and noise; so, in a sort of a
half-secret fashion, they were wedded.&nbsp; Einion was very desirous to go
once more among his own people, accompanied, to be sure, by his wife.&nbsp;
After he had been long entreating the old man for leave, they set out on
two white ponies, that were, in fact, more like snow than anything else in
point of colour; so he arrived with his consort in his old home, and it was
the opinion of all that Einion&rsquo;s wife was the handsomest person they
had anywhere seen.&nbsp; Whilst at home, a son was born to them, to whom
they gave the name of Taliesin.&nbsp; Einion was now in the enjoyment of
high repute, and his wife received proper respect.&nbsp; Their wealth was
immense, and soon they acquired a large estate; but it was not long till
people began to inquire after the pedigree of Einion&rsquo;s wife&mdash;the
country was of opinion that it was not the right <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>thing to be without a
pedigree.&nbsp; Einion was questioned about it, without his giving any
satisfactory answer, and one came to the conclusion that she was one of the
Fair Family (<i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>).&nbsp; &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo;
replied Einion, &lsquo;there can be no doubt that she comes from a very
fair family, for she has two sisters who are as fair as she, and if you saw
them together, you would admit that name to be a capital one.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This, then, is the reason why the remarkable family in the land of charm
and phantasy (<i>Hud a Lledrith</i>) are called the Fair Family.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>7.&nbsp; <i>A Boy taken to Fairy Land</i>.</h4>
<p>Mrs. Morris, of Cwm Vicarage, near Rhyl, told the writer the following
story.&nbsp; She stated that she had heard it related in her family that
one of their people had in childhood been induced by the Fairies to follow
them to their country.&nbsp; This boy had been sent to discharge some
domestic errand, but he did not return.&nbsp; He was sought for in all
directions but could not be found.&nbsp; His parents came to the conclusion
that he had either been murdered or kidnapped, and in time he was forgotten
by most people, but one day he returned with what he had been sent for in
his hand.&nbsp; But so many years had elapsed since he first left home,
that he was now an old grey-headed man, though he knew it not; he had, he
said, followed, for a short time, delightful music and people; but when
convinced, by the changes around, that years had slipped by since he first
left his home, he was so distressed at the changes he saw that he said he
would return to the Fairies.&nbsp; But alas! he sought in vain for the
place where he had met them, and therefore he was obliged to remain with
his blood relations.</p>
<p>The next tale differs from the preceding, insomuch that the seductive
advances of the Fairies failed in their object.&nbsp; I am not quite
positive whence I obtained the story, but <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>this much I know, that
it belongs to Pentrevoelas, and that a respectable old man was in the habit
of repeating it, as an event in his own life.</p>
<h4><i>A Man Refusing the Solicitations of the Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>A Pentrevoelas man was coming home one lovely summer&rsquo;s night, and
when within a stone&rsquo;s throw of his house, he heard in the far
distance singing of the most enchanting kind.&nbsp; He stopped to listen to
the sweet sounds which filled him with a sensation of deep pleasure.&nbsp;
He had not listened long ere he perceived that the singers were
approaching.&nbsp; By and by they came to the spot where he was, and he saw
that they were marching in single file and consisted of a number of small
people, robed in close-fitting grey clothes, and they were accompanied by
speckled dogs that marched along two deep like soldiers.&nbsp; When the
procession came quite opposite the enraptured listener, it stopped, and the
small people spoke to him and earnestly begged him to accompany them, but
he would not.&nbsp; They tried many ways, and for a long time, to persuade
him to join them, but when they saw they could not induce him to do so they
departed, dividing themselves into two companies and marching away, the
dogs marching two abreast in front of each company.&nbsp; They sang as they
went away the most entrancing music that was ever heard.&nbsp; The man,
spell-bound, stood where he was, listening to the ravishing music of the
Fairies, and he did not enter his house until the last sound had died away
in the far-off distance.</p>
<p>Professor Rhys records a tale much like the preceding.&nbsp; (See his
<i>Welsh Fairy Tales</i>, pp. 34, 35.)&nbsp; It is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;One bright moonlight night, as one of the sons of the
farmer who lived at Llwyn On in Nant y Bettws was going to pay his
addresses to a girl at Clogwyn y Gwin, he beheld the Tylwyth enjoying
themselves in full swing on a meadow <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>close to Cwellyn
Lake.&nbsp; He approached them and little by little he was led on by the
enchanting sweetness of their music and the liveliness of their playing
until he got within their circle.&nbsp; Soon some kind of spell passed over
him, so that he lost his knowledge of every place, and found himself in a
country the most beautiful he had ever seen, where everybody spent his time
in mirth and rejoicing.&nbsp; He had been there seven years, and yet it
seemed to him but a night&rsquo;s dream; but a faint recollection came to
his mind of the business on which he had left home, and he felt a longing
to see his beloved one: so he went and asked permission to return home,
which was granted him, together with a host of attendants to lead him to
his country; and, suddenly, he found himself, as waking from a dream, on
the bank where he had seen the Fairy Family amusing themselves.&nbsp; He
turned towards home, but there he found everything changed: his parents
were dead, his brothers could not recognize him, and his sweetheart was
married to another man.&nbsp; In consequence of such changes, he broke his
heart, and died in less than a week after coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many variants of the legends already related are still extant in
Wales.&nbsp; This much can be said of these tales, that it was formerly
believed that marriages took place between men and Fairies, and from the
tales themselves we can infer that the men fared better in Fairy land than
the Fairy ladies did in the country of their earthly husbands.&nbsp; This,
perhaps, is what might be expected, if, as we may suppose, the Fair Tribe
were supplanted, and overcome, by a stronger, and bolder people, with whom,
to a certain extent, the weaker and conquered or subdued race commingled by
marriage.&nbsp; Certain striking characteristics of both races are strongly
marked in these legends.&nbsp; The one is a smaller and more timid people
than the other, and far more <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>beautiful in mind and person than their
conquerors.&nbsp; The ravishing beauty of the Fairy lady forms a prominent
feature in all these legends.&nbsp; The Fairies, too, are spoken of as
being without religion.&nbsp; This, perhaps, means nothing more than that
they differed from their conquerors in forms, or objects of worship.&nbsp;
However this might be, it would appear that their conquerors knew but
little of that perfect moral teaching which made the Fairies, according to
the testimony of Giraldus, truthful, void of ambition, and honest.</p>
<p>It must, however, be confessed, that there is much that is mythical in
these legends, and every part cannot well be made to correspond with
ordinary human transactions.</p>
<p>It is somewhat amusing to note how modern ideas, and customs, are mixed
up with these ancient stories.&nbsp; They undoubtedly received a gloss from
the ages which transmitted the tales.</p>
<p>In the next chapter I shall treat of another phase of Fairy Folk-lore,
which will still further connect the Fair Race with their conquerors.</p>
<h3>FAIRY CHANGELINGS.</h3>
<p>It was firmly believed, at one time, in Wales, that the Fairies
exchanged their own weakly or deformed offspring for the strong children of
mortals.&nbsp; The child supposed to have been left by the Fairies in the
cradle, or elsewhere, was commonly called a changeling.&nbsp; This faith
was not confined to Wales; it was as common in Ireland, Scotland, and
England, as it was in Wales.&nbsp; Thus, in Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faery
Queen</i>, reference is made in the following words to this popular
error:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And her base Elfin brood there for thee left;<br />
Such, men do chaungelings call, so chaung&rsquo;d by Faeries theft.</p>
<p><i>Faery Queen</i>, Bk. I, c. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>The same superstition is thus alluded to by
Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lovely boy, stol&rsquo;n from an Indian king,<br />
She never had so sweet a changeling.</p>
<p><i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Act II., Sc. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, in another of his plays, the Fairy practice of exchanging
children is mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  O, that it could be prov&rsquo;d,<br />
That some night-tripping Fairy had exchanged<br />
In cradle-clothes our children, where they lay,<br />
And call&rsquo;d mine, Percy, his Plantagenet:<br />
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</p>
<p><i>Henry IV</i>., Pt. 1., Act I, Sc. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Scotland and other countries the Fairies were credited with stealing
unbaptized infants, and leaving in their stead poor, sickly, noisy, thin,
babies.&nbsp; But to return to Wales, a poet in <i>Y Brython</i>, vol. iii,
p. 103, thus sings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llawer plentyn teg aeth ganddynt,<br />
&nbsp;  Pan y cym&rsquo;rynt helynt hir;<br />
Oddi ar anwyl dda rieni,<br />
&nbsp;  I drigfanau difri dir.</p>
<p>Many a lovely child they&rsquo;ve taken,<br />
&nbsp;  When long and bitter was the pain;<br />
From their parents, loving, dear,<br />
&nbsp;  To the Fairies&rsquo; dread domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Williams, an old man, who lived in the Penrhyn quarry district,
informed the writer that he could reveal strange doings of the Fairies in
his neighbourhood, for often had they changed children with even well-to-do
families, he said, but more he would not say, lest he should injure those
prosperous families.</p>
<p>It was believed that the Fairies were particularly busy in exchanging
children on <i>Nos Wyl Ifan</i>, or St. John&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<p>There were, however, effectual means for protecting children from their
machinations.&nbsp; The mother&rsquo;s presence, the tongs placed
cross-ways on the cradle, the early <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>baptism of the child,
were all preventives.&nbsp; In the Western Isles of Scotland fire carried
round a woman before she was churched, and round the child until he was
christened, daily, night and morning, preserved both from the evil designs
of the Fairies.&nbsp; (Brand, vol. ii, p. 486.)&nbsp; And it will be
shortly shewn that even after an exchange had been accomplished there were
means of forcing the Fairies to restore the stolen child.</p>
<p>It can well be believed that mothers who had sickly or idiotic babies
would, in uncivilized places, gladly embrace the idea that the child she
nursed was a changeling, and then, naturally enough, she would endeavour to
recover her own again.&nbsp; The plan adopted for this purpose was
extremely dangerous.&nbsp; I will in the following tales show what steps
were taken to reclaim the lost child.</p>
<p>Pennant records how a woman who had a peevish child acted to regain from
the Fairies her own offspring.&nbsp; His words are:&mdash;&ldquo;Above this
is a spreading oak of great antiquity, size, and extent of branches; it has
got the name of <i>Fairy Oak</i>.&nbsp; In this very century (the
eighteenth) a poor cottager, who lived near the spot, had a child who grew
uncommonly peevish; the parents attributed this to the <i>Fairies</i>, and
imagined that it was a changeling.&nbsp; They took the child, put it into a
cradle, and left it all night beneath the tree, in hopes that the
<i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>, or <i>Fairy Family</i>, or the Fairy folk, would
restore their own before the morning.&nbsp; When morning came, they found
the child perfectly quiet, so went away with it, quite confirmed in their
belief.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>History of Whiteford</i>, pp. 5, 6.</p>
<p>These people by exposing their infant for a night to the elements ran a
risk of losing it altogether; but they acted in agreement with the popular
opinion, which was that the Fairies had such affection for their own
children that they <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>would not allow them to be in any danger of
losing their life, and that if the elfin child were thus exposed the
Fairies would rescue it, and restore the exchanged child to its
parents.&nbsp; The following tale exhibits another phase of this
belief.</p>
<p>The story is to be found in the <i>Cambrian Magazine</i>, vol. ii., pp.
86, 87.</p>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>The Egg Shell Pottage</i>.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>&ldquo;In the parish of Treveglwys, near Llanidloes, in the county of
Montgomery, there is a little shepherd&rsquo;s cot, that is commonly called
Twt y Cwmrws (the place of strife) on account of the extraordinary strife
that has been there.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the cottage were a man and
his wife, and they had born to them twins, whom the woman nursed with great
care and tenderness.&nbsp; Some months afterwards indispensable business
called the wife to the house of one of her nearest neighbours; yet,
notwithstanding she had not far to go, she did not like to leave her
children by themselves in their cradle, even for a minute, as her house was
solitary, and there were many tales of goblins or the &lsquo;<i>Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i>&rsquo; (the Fair Family or the Fairies) haunting the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; However, she went, and returned as soon as she could;
but on coming back she felt herself not a little terrified on seeing,
though it was mid-day, some of &lsquo;the old elves of the blue
petticoat,&rsquo; as they are usually called; however, when she got back to
her house she was rejoiced to find everything in the state she had left
it.</p>
<p>But after some time had passed by, the good people began to wonder that
the twins did not grow at all, but still continued little dwarfs.&nbsp; The
man would have it that they were not his children; the woman said that they
must be their children, and about this arose the great strife between them
that gave name to the place.&nbsp; One evening when the woman <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>was very heavy
of heart she determined to go and consult a <i>Gwr Cyfarwydd</i> (i.e., a
wise man, or a conjuror), feeling assured that everything was known to him,
and he gave her his counsel.&nbsp; Now there was to be a harvest soon of
the rye and oats; so the wise man said to her:&mdash;&lsquo;When you are
preparing dinner for the reapers empty the shell of a hen&rsquo;s egg, and
boil the shell full of pottage and take it out through the door as if you
meant it for a dinner to the reapers, and then listen what the twins will
say; if you hear the children speaking things above the understanding of
children, return into the house, take them, and throw them into the waves
of Llyn Ebyr, which is very near to you; but if you don&rsquo;t hear
anything remarkable, do them no injury.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when the day of
the reaping came, the woman did as her adviser had recommended to her; and
as she went outside the door to listen, she heard one of the children say
to the other:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gwelais vesen cyn gweled derwen,<br />
&nbsp;  Gwelais wy cyn gweled i&acirc;r,<br />
Erioed ni welais verwi bwyd i vedel<br />
&nbsp;  Mewn plisgyn wy i&acirc;r!</p>
<p>Acorns before oak I knew,<br />
&nbsp;  An egg before a hen,<br />
Never one hen&rsquo;s egg-shell stew<br />
&nbsp;  Enough for harvest men!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this the mother returned to her house and took the two children, and
threw them into the Llyn, and suddenly the goblins in their trousers came
to save their dwarfs, and the woman had her own children back again, and
thus the strife between her and her husband ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer of the preceding story says that it was translated almost
literally from Welsh, as told by the peasantry, and he remarks that the
legend bears a striking resemblance to one of the Irish tales published by
Mr. Croker.</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Many variants of the legend are still extant in many parts of
Wales.&nbsp; There is one of these recorded in Professor Rhys&rsquo;s
<i>Welsh Fairy Tales</i>, <i>Y Cymmrodor</i>, vol. iv., pp. 208-209.&nbsp;
It is much like that given in the <i>Cambrian Magazine</i>.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; <i>Corwrion Changeling Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>Once on a time, in the fourteenth century, the wife of a man at Corwrion
had twins, and she complained one day to the witch who lived close by, at
Tyddyn y Barcut, that the children were not getting on, but that they were
always crying, day and night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you sure that they are your
children?&rsquo; asked the witch, adding that it did not seem to her that
they were like hers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have my doubts also,&rsquo; said the
mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder if somebody has changed children with
you,&rsquo; said the witch.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said the
mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;But why do you not seek to know?&rsquo; asked the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;But how am I to go about it?&rsquo; said the
mother.&nbsp; The witch replied, &lsquo;Go and do something rather strange
before their eyes and watch what they will say to one another.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well I do not know what I should do,&rsquo; said the mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;take an egg-shell, and proceed to
brew beer in it in a chamber aside, and come here to tell me what the
children will say about it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She went home and did as the witch
had directed her, when the two children lifted their heads out of the
cradle to see what she was doing, to watch, and to listen.&nbsp; Then one
observed to the other:&mdash;&lsquo;I remember seeing an oak having an
acorn,&rsquo; to which the other replied, &lsquo;And I remember seeing a
hen having an egg,&rsquo; and one of the two added, &lsquo;But I do not
remember before seeing anybody brew beer in the shell of a hen&rsquo;s
egg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mother then went to the witch and told her what <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the twins had said one
to the other, and she directed her to go to a small wooden bridge not far
off, with one of the strange children under each arm, and there to drop
them from the bridge into the river beneath.&nbsp; The mother went back
home again and did as she had been directed.&nbsp; When she reached home
this time, to her astonishment, she found that her own children had been
brought back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one important difference between these two tales.&nbsp; In the
latter, the mother drops the children over the bridge into the waters
beneath, and then goes home, without noticing whether the poor children had
been rescued by the goblins or not, but on reaching her home she found in
the cradle her own two children, presumably conveyed there by the
Fairies.&nbsp; In the first tale, we are informed that she saw the goblins
save their offspring from a watery grave.&nbsp; Subjecting peevish children
to such a terrible ordeal as this must have ended often with a tragedy, but
even in such cases superstitious mothers could easily persuade themselves
that the destroyed infants were undoubtedly the offspring of elfins, and
therefore unworthy of their fostering care.&nbsp; The only safeguard to
wholesale infanticide was the test applied as to the super-human
precociousness, or ordinary intelligence, of the children.</p>
<p>Another version of this tale was related to me by my young friend, the
Rev. D. H. Griffiths, of Clocaenog Rectory, near Ruthin.&nbsp; The tale was
told him by Evan Roberts, Ffriddagored, Llanfwrog.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts is an
aged farmer.</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp; <i>Llanfwrog Changeling Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>A mother took her child to the gleaning field, and left it sleeping
under the sheaves of wheat whilst she was busily engaged gleaning.&nbsp;
The Fairies came to the field and carried off her pretty baby, leaving in
its place one of their own infants.&nbsp; At the time, the mother did not
notice any <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>difference between her own child and the one that took its place,
but after awhile she observed with grief that the baby she was nursing did
not thrive, nor did it grow, nor would it try to walk.&nbsp; She mentioned
these facts to her neighbours, and she was told to do something strange and
then listen to its conversation.&nbsp; She took an egg-shell and pretended
to brew beer in it, and she was then surprised to hear the child, who had
observed her actions intently, say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mi welais fesen gan dderwen,<br />
&nbsp;  Mi welais wy gan i&acirc;r,<br />
Ond ni welais i erioed ddarllaw<br />
&nbsp;  Mewn cibyn wy i&acirc;r.</p>
<p>I have seen an oak having an acorn,<br />
&nbsp;  I have seen a hen having an egg,<br />
But I never saw before brewing<br />
&nbsp;  In the shell of a hen&rsquo;s egg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conversation proved the origin of the precocious child who lay in
the cradle.&nbsp; The stanza was taken down from Roberts&rsquo;s
lips.&nbsp; But he could not say what was done to the fairy changeling.</p>
<p>In Ireland a plan for reclaiming the child carried away by the Fairies
was to take the Fairy&rsquo;s changeling and place it on the top of a
dunghill, and then to chant certain invocatory lines beseeching the Fairies
to restore the stolen child.</p>
<p>There was, it would seem, in Wales, a certain form of incantation
resorted to to reclaim children from the Fairies, which was as
follows:&mdash;The mother who had lost her child was to carry the
changeling to a river, but she was to be accompanied by a conjuror, who was
to take a prominent part in the ceremony.&nbsp; When at the river&rsquo;s
brink the conjuror was to cry out:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crap ar y wrach&mdash;</p>
<p>A grip on the hag;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>and the mother was to respond&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rhy hwyr gyfraglach&mdash;</p>
<p>Too late decrepit one;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and having uttered these words, she was to throw the child into the
stream, and to depart, and it was believed that on reaching her home she
would there find her own child safe and sound.</p>
<p>I have already alluded to the horrible nature of such a
proceeding.&nbsp; I will now relate a tale somewhat resembling those
already given, but in this latter case, the supposed changeling became the
mainstay of his family.&nbsp; I am indebted for the <i>Gors Goch</i> legend
to an essay, written by Mr. D. Williams, Llanfachreth, Merionethshire,
which took the prize at the Liverpool Eisteddfod, 1870, and which appears
in a publication called <i>Y Gordofigion</i>, pp. 96, 97, published by Mr.
I. Foulkes, Liverpool.</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>The Gore Goch Changeling Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>The tale rendered into English is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;There was
once a happy family living in a place called Gors Goch.&nbsp; One night, as
usual, they went to bed, but they could not sleep a single wink, because of
the noise outside the house.&nbsp; At last the master of the house got up,
and trembling, enquired &lsquo;What was there, and what was
wanted.&rsquo;&nbsp; A clear sweet voice answered him thus, &lsquo;We want
a warm place where we can tidy the children.&rsquo;&nbsp; The door was
opened when there entered half full the house of the <i>Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i>, and they began forthwith washing their children.&nbsp; And
when they had finished, they commenced singing, and the singing was
entrancing.&nbsp; The dancing and the singing were both excellent.&nbsp; On
going away they left behind them money not a little for the use of the
house.&nbsp; And afterwards they came pretty often to the house, and
received a hearty welcome in consequence of the large presents which they
left <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>behind them on the hob.&nbsp; But at last a sad affair took place
which was no less than an exchange of children.&nbsp; The Gors Goch baby
was a dumpy child, a sweet, pretty, affectionate little dear, but the child
which was left in its stead was a sickly, thin, shapeless, ugly being,
which did nothing but cry and eat, and although it ate ravenously like a
mastiff, it did not grow.&nbsp; At last the wife of Gors Goch died of a
broken heart, and so also did all her children, but the father lived a long
life and became a rich man, because his new heir&rsquo;s family brought him
abundance of gold and silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have already given more than one variant of the same legend, I will
supply another version of the Gors Goch legend which appears in <i>Cymru
Fu</i>, pp. 177-8, from the pen of the Revd. Owen Wyn Jones,
<i>Glasynys</i>, and which in consequence of the additional facts contained
in it may be of some value.&nbsp; I will make use of Professor Rhys&rsquo;s
translation.&nbsp; (See <i>Y Cymmrodor</i>, vol. v., pp. 79-80.)</p>
<h4>5.&nbsp; <i>Another Version of the Gors Goch Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;When the people of the Gors Goch one evening had gone to bed, lo!
they heard a great row and disturbance around the house.&nbsp; One could
not at all comprehend what it might be that made a noise that time of
night.&nbsp; Both the husband and the wife had waked up, quite unable to
make out what there might be there.&nbsp; The children also woke but no one
could utter a word; their tongues had all stuck to the roofs of their
mouths.&nbsp; The husband, however, at last managed to move, and to ask,
&lsquo;Who is there?&nbsp; What do you want?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he was
answered from without by a small silvery voice, &lsquo;It is room we want
to dress our children.&rsquo;&nbsp; The door was opened, and a dozen small
beings came in, and began to search for an earthen pitcher with water;
there they remained for some hours, washing and titivating
themselves.&nbsp; As the day was breaking they went away, leaving <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>behind them a
fine present for the kindness they had received.&nbsp; Often afterwards did
the Gors Goch folks have the company of this family.&nbsp; But once there
happened to be a fine roll of a pretty baby in his cradle.&nbsp; The Fair
Family came, and, as the baby had not been baptized, they took the liberty
of changing him for one of their own.&nbsp; They left behind in his stead
an abominable creature that would do nothing but cry and scream every day
of the week.&nbsp; The mother was nearly breaking her heart, on account of
the misfortune, and greatly afraid of telling anybody about it.&nbsp; But
everybody got to see that there was something wrong at Gors Goch, which was
proved before long by the mother dying of longing for her child.&nbsp; The
other children died broken-hearted after their mother, and the husband was
left alone with the little elf without anyone to comfort them.&nbsp; But
shortly after, the Fairies began to resort again to the hearth of the Gors
Goch to dress children, and the gift which had formerly been silver money
became henceforth pure gold.&nbsp; In the course of a few years the elf
became the heir of a large farm in North Wales, and that is why the old
people used to say, &lsquo;Shoe the elf with gold and he will
grow.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<i>Fe ddaw gwiddon yn fawr ond ei bedoli &acirc;g
aur</i>.)</p>
<p>It will be observed that this latter version differs in one remarkable
incident from the preceding tale.&nbsp; In the former there is no allusion
to the fact that the changed child had not been baptized; in the latter,
this omission is specially mentioned as giving power to the Fairies to
exchange their own child for the human baby.&nbsp; This preventive carries
these tales into Christian days.&nbsp; Another tale, which I will now
relate, also proves that faith in the Fairies and in the efficacy of the
Cross existed at one and the same time.&nbsp; The tale is taken from <i>Y
Gordofigion</i>, p. 96.&nbsp; I will first give it as it originally
appeared, and then I will translate the story.</p>
<h4><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>6.&nbsp; <i>Garth Uchaf, Llanuwchllyn</i>, <i>Changeling
Legend</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Yr oedd gwraig Garth Uchaf, yn Llanuwchllyn, un tro wedi myned
allan i gweirio gwair, a gadael ei baban yn y cryd; ond fel bu&rsquo;r
anffawd, ni roddodd yr efail yn groes ar wyneb y cryd, ac o ganlyniad,
ffeiriwyd ei baban gan y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g, ac erbyn iddi ddyfod i&rsquo;r
ty, nid oedd yn y cryd ond rhyw hen gyfraglach o blentyn fel pe buasai wedi
ei haner lewygu o eisiau ymborth, ond magwyd ef er hyny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife of Garth Uchaf, Llanuwchllyn, went out one day to make hay, and
left her baby in the cradle.&nbsp; <i>Unfortunately</i>, <i>she did not
place the tongs crossways on the cradle</i>, and consequently the Fairies
changed her baby, and by the time she came home there was nothing in the
cradle but some old decrepit changeling, which looked is if it were half
famished, but nevertheless, it was nursed.</p>
<p>The reason why the Fairies exchanged babies with human beings, judging
from the stories already given, was their desire to obtain healthy
well-formed children in the place of their own puny ill-shaped offspring,
but this is hardly a satisfactory explanation of such conduct.&nbsp; A
mother&rsquo;s love is ever depicted as being so intense that deformity on
the part of her child rather increases than diminishes her affection for
her unfortunate babe.&nbsp; In Scotland the difficulty is solved in a
different way.&nbsp; There it was once thought that the Fairies were
obliged every seventh year to pay to the great enemy of mankind an offering
of one of their own children, or a human child instead, and as a mother is
ever a mother, be she elves flesh or Eve&rsquo;s flesh, she always
endeavoured to substitute some one else&rsquo;s child for her own, and
hence the reason for exchanging children.</p>
<p>In Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s <i>Traditional Tales</i>, Morley&rsquo;s
edition, p. 188, mention is made of this belief.&nbsp; He
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard it said by douce Folk,&rsquo;
&lsquo;and sponsible,&rsquo; interrupted another, &lsquo;that every seven
years the elves and Fairies pay kane, or make an offering of one of their
children, to the grand enemy of salvation, and that they are permitted to
purloin one of the children of men to present to the fiend,&rsquo; &lsquo;a
more acceptable offering, I&rsquo;ll warrant, than one of their own
infernal blood that are Satan&rsquo;s sib allies, and drink a drop of the
deil&rsquo;s blood every May morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Peter Roberts&rsquo;s theory was that the smaller race
kidnapped the children of the stronger race, who occupied the country
concurrently with themselves, for the purpose of adding to their own
strength as a people.</p>
<p>Gay, in lines quoted in Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular Antiquities</i>, vol.
ii., p. 485, laughs at the idea of changelings.&nbsp; A Fairy&rsquo;s
tongue ridicules the superstition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whence sprung the vain conceited lye,<br />
That we the world with fools supply?<br />
What!&nbsp; Give our sprightly race away<br />
For the dull helpless sons of clay!<br />
Besides, by partial fondness shown,<br />
Like you, we dote upon our own.<br />
Where ever yet was found a mother<br />
Who&rsquo;d give her booby for another?<br />
And should we change with human breed,<br />
Well might we pass for fools, indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the above fine satire I bring my remarks on Fairy Changelings to a
close.</p>
<h3>FAIRY MOTHERS AND HUMAN MIDWIVES.</h3>
<p>Fairies are represented in Wales as possessing all the passions,
appetites, and wants of human beings.&nbsp; There are many tales current of
their soliciting help and favours in their need from men and women.&nbsp;
Just as uncivilized nations acknowledge the superiority of Europeans in
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>medicine, so did the Fairies resort in perplexing cases to man for
aid.&nbsp; There is a class of tales which has reached our days in which
the Fairy lady, who is about to become a mother, obtains from amongst men a
midwife, whom she rewards with rich presents for her services.&nbsp;
Variants of this story are found in many parts of Wales, and in many
continental countries.&nbsp; I will relate a few of these legends.</p>
<h4>1.&nbsp; <i>Denbighshire Version of a Fairy Mother and Human
Midwife</i>.</h4>
<p>The following story I received from the lips of David Roberts, whom I
have previously mentioned, a native of Denbighshire, and he related the
tale as one commonly known.&nbsp; As might be expected, he locates the
event in Denbighshire, but I have no recollection that he gave names.&nbsp;
His narrative was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>A well-known midwife, whose services were much sought after in
consequence of her great skill, had one night retired to rest, when she was
disturbed by a loud knocking at her door.&nbsp; She immediately got up and
went to the door, and there saw a beautiful carriage, which she was
urgently requested to enter at once to be conveyed to a house where her
help was required.&nbsp; She did so, and after a long drive the carriage
drew up before the entrance to a large mansion, which she had never seen
before.&nbsp; She successfully performed her work, and stayed on in the
place until her services were no longer required.&nbsp; Then she was
conveyed home in the same manner as she had come, but with her went many
valuable presents in grateful recognition of the services she had
rendered.</p>
<p>The midwife somehow or other found out that she had been attending a
Fairy mother.&nbsp; Some time after her return from Fairy land she went to
a fair, and there she saw the <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>lady whom she had put to bed nimbly going from
stall to stall, and making many purchases.&nbsp; For awhile she watched the
movements of the lady, and then presuming on her limited acquaintance,
addressed her, and asked how she was.&nbsp; The lady seemed surprised and
annoyed at the woman&rsquo;s speech, and instead of answering her, said,
&ldquo;And do you see me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said the
midwife.&nbsp; &ldquo;With which eye?&rdquo; enquired the Fairy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With this,&rdquo; said the woman, placing her hand on the eye.&nbsp;
No sooner had she spoken than the Fairy lady touched that eye, and the
midwife could no longer see the Fairy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lowri Wynn, Clocaenog, near Ruthin, who has reached her eightieth
year, and is herself a midwife, gave me a version of the preceding which
differed therefrom in one or two particulars.&nbsp; The Fairy gentleman who
had driven the woman to and from the Hall was the one that was seen in the
fair, said Mrs. Wynn, and he it was that put out the eye or blinded it, she
was not sure which, of the inquisitive midwife, and Lowri thought it was
the left eye.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; <i>Merionethshire Version of the Fairy Mother and Human
Midwife</i>.</h4>
<p>A more complete version of this legend is given in the
<i>Gordofigion</i>, pp. 97, 98.&nbsp; The writer says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yr oedd bydwraig yn Llanuwchllyn wedi cael ei galw i Goed y
Garth, sef Siambra Duon&mdash;cartref y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g&mdash;at un o
honynt ar enedigaeth baban.&nbsp; Dywedasant wrthi am gymeryd gofal rhag,
cyffwrdd y dwfr oedd ganddi yn trin y babi yn agos i&rsquo;w llygaid; ond
cyffyrddodd y wraig &acirc;&rsquo;r llygad aswy yn ddigon difeddwl.&nbsp;
Yn y Bala, ymhen ychydig, gwelai y fydwraig y gwr, sef tad y bab&agrave;n,
a dechreuodd ei holi pa sut yr oeddynt yn Siambra Duon? pa fodd yr oedd y
wraig? a sut &rsquo;roedd y teulu bach i gyd?&nbsp; Edrychai yntau arni yn
graff, a gofynodd, &lsquo;A pha lygad yr <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>ydych yn fy ngweled
i?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A hwn,&rsquo; ebe hithau, gan gyfeirio at ei llygad
aswy.&nbsp; Tynodd yntau y llygad hwnw o&rsquo;i phen, ac yna nis
gallai&rsquo;r wraig ei ganfod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This in English is:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was a midwife who lived at Llanuwchllyn, who was called to Coed y
Garth, that is, to Siambra Duon, the home of the Tylwyth T&ecirc;g, to
attend to one of them in child birth.&nbsp; They told her to be careful not
to touch her eyes with the water used in washing the baby, but quite
unintentionally the woman touched her left eye.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards
the midwife saw the Fairy&rsquo;s husband at Bala, and she began enquiring
how they all were at Siambra Duon, how the wife was, and how the little
family was?&nbsp; He looked at her intently, and then asked, &ldquo;With
which eye do you see me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With this,&rdquo; she said,
pointing to her left eye.&nbsp; He plucked that eye out of her head, and so
the woman could not see him.</p>
<p>With regard to this tale, the woman&rsquo;s eye is said to have been
plucked out; in the first tale she was only deprived of her supernatural
power of sight; in other versions the woman becomes blind with one eye.</p>
<p>Professor Rhys in <i>Y Cymmrodor</i>, vol. iv., pp. 209, 210, gives a
variant of the midwife story which differs in some particulars from that
already related.&nbsp; I will call this the Corwrion version.</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp; <i>The Corwrion Version</i>.</h4>
<p>One of the Fairies came to a midwife who lived at Corwrion and asked her
to come with him and attend on his wife.&nbsp; Off she went with him, and
she was astonished to be taken into a splendid palace.&nbsp; There she
continued to go night and morning to dress the baby for some time, until
one day the husband asked her to rub her eyes with a certain ointment he
offered her.&nbsp; She did so and found <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>herself sitting on a
tuft of rushes, and not in a palace.&nbsp; There was no baby, and all had
disappeared.&nbsp; Some time afterwards she happened to go to the town, and
whom should she see busily buying various wares but the Fairy on whose wife
she had been attending.&nbsp; She addressed him with the question,
&ldquo;How are you, to-day?&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead of answering her he asked,
&ldquo;How do you see me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With my eyes,&rdquo; was the
prompt reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which eye?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
one,&rdquo; said she, pointing to it; and instantly he disappeared, never
more to be seen by her.</p>
<p>There is yet one other variant of this story which I will give, and for
the sake of reference I will call it the Nanhwynan version.&nbsp; It
appears in the <i>Brython</i>, vol. ix., p. 251, and Professor Rhys has
rendered it into English in <i>Y Cymmrodor</i>, vol. ix., p. 70.&nbsp; I
will give the tale as related by the Professor.</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>The Nanhwynan Version</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Once on a time, when a midwife from Nanhwynan had newly got to
the Hafodydd Brithion to pursue her calling, a gentleman came to the door
on a fine grey steed and bade her come with him at once.&nbsp; Such was the
authority with which he spoke, that the poor midwife durst not refuse to
go, however much it was her duty to stay where she was.&nbsp; So she
mounted behind him, and off they went like the flight of a swallow, through
Cwmllan, over the Bwlch, down Nant yr Aran, and over the Gadair to Cwm
Hafod Ruffydd, before the poor woman had time to say
&lsquo;Oh.&rsquo;&nbsp; When they had got there she saw before her a
magnificent mansion, splendidly lit up with such lamps as she had never
before seen.&nbsp; They entered the court, and a crowd of servants in
expensive liveries came to meet them, and she was at once led through the
great hall into a bed-chamber, the like of which she had never seen.&nbsp;
There the mistress of the house, <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>to whom she had been fetched, was awaiting
her.&nbsp; She got through her duties successfully, and stayed there until
the lady had completely recovered; nor had she spent any part of her life
so merrily.&nbsp; There was there nought but festivity day and night:
dancing, singing, and endless rejoicing reigned there.&nbsp; But merry as
it was, she found she must go, and the nobleman gave her a large purse,
with the order not to open it until she had got into her own house; then he
bade one of his servants escort her the same way she had come.&nbsp; When
she reached home she opened the purse, and, to her great joy, it was full
of money, and she lived happily on those earnings to the end of her
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such are these tales.&nbsp; Perhaps they are one and all fragments of
the same story.&nbsp; Each contains a few shreds that are wanting in the
others.&nbsp; All, however, agree in one leading idea, that Fairy mothers
have, ere now, obtained the aid of human midwives, and this one fact is a
connecting link between the people called Fairies and our own remote
forefathers.</p>
<h3>FAIRY VISITS TO HUMAN ABODES.</h3>
<p>Old people often told their children and servant girls, that one
condition of the Fairy visits to their houses was cleanliness.&nbsp; They
were always instructed to keep the fire place tidy and the floor well
swept, the pails filled with water, and to make everything bright and nice
before going to bed, and that then, perhaps, the Fairies would come into
the house to dance and sing until the morning, and leave on the hearth
stone a piece of money as a reward behind them.&nbsp; But should the house
be dirty, never would the Fairies enter it to hold their nightly revels,
unless, forsooth, they came to punish the slatternly servant.&nbsp; Such
was the popular opinion, and it must have acted as an incentive to order
and cleanliness.&nbsp; These ideas have found expression in song.</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>A
writer in <i>Yr Hynafion Cymreig</i>, p. 153, sings thus of the place loved
by the Fairies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ysgafn ddrws pren, llawr gl&acirc;n dan nen,<br />
&nbsp;  A&rsquo;r aelwyd wen yn wir,<br />
T&acirc;n golau draw, y dwr gerllaw,<br />
&nbsp;  Yn siriaw&rsquo;r cylchgrwn clir.</p>
<p>A light door, and clean white floor,<br />
&nbsp;  And hearth-stone bright indeed,<br />
A burning fire, and water near,<br />
&nbsp;  Supplies our every need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a ballad, entitled &ldquo;The Fairy Queen,&rdquo; in Percy&rsquo;s
<i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i>, Nichols&rsquo;s edition, vol.
iii., p. 172, are stanzas similar to the Welsh verse given above, which
also partially embody the Welsh opinions of Fairy visits to their
houses.&nbsp; Thus chants the &ldquo;Fairy Queen&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  When mortals are at rest,<br />
&nbsp;  And snoring in their nest,<br />
&nbsp;  Unheard, and un-espy&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;  Through key-holes we do glide;<br />
Over tables, stools, and shelves,<br />
We trip it with our Fairy elves.<br />
&nbsp;  And, if the house be foul<br />
&nbsp;  With platter, dish, or bowl,<br />
&nbsp;  Upstairs we nimbly creep,<br />
&nbsp;  And find the sluts asleep:<br />
There we pinch their arms and thighs;<br />
None escapes, nor none espies.<br />
&nbsp;  But if the house be swept<br />
&nbsp;  And from uncleanness kept,<br />
&nbsp;  We praise the household maid,<br />
&nbsp;  And duely she is paid:<br />
For we use before we goe<br />
To drop a tester in her shoe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not for the sake of mirth only that the Fairies entered human
abodes, but for the performance of more <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>mundane duties, such as
making oatmeal cakes.&nbsp; The Rev. R. Jones, Rector of Llanycil, told me
a story, current in his native parish, Llanfrothen, Merionethshire, to the
effect that a Fairy woman who had spent the night in baking cakes in a farm
house forgot on leaving to take with her the wooden utensil used in turning
the cakes on the bake stone; so she returned, and failing to discover the
lost article bewailed her loss in these words, &ldquo;Mi gollais fy
mhig,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have lost my shovel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people got up
and searched for the lost implement, and found it, and gave it to the
Fairy, who departed with it in her possession.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Fairies frequented human abodes was to wash and
tidy their children.&nbsp; In the Gors Goch legend, already given, is
recorded this cause of their visits.&nbsp; Many like stories are
extant.&nbsp; It is said that the nightly visitors expected water to be
provided for them, and if this were not the case they resented the slight
thus shown them and punished those who neglected paying attention to their
wants.&nbsp; But tradition says the house-wives were ever careful of the
Fairy wants; and, as it was believed that Fairy mothers preferred using the
same water in which human children had been washed, the human mother left
this water in the bowl for their special use.</p>
<p>In Scotland, also, Fairies were propitiated by attention being paid to
their wants.&nbsp; Thus in Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s <i>Traditional
Tales</i>, p. 11, it is said of Ezra Peden:&mdash;&ldquo;He rebuked a
venerable dame, during three successive Sundays for placing a cream bowl
and new-baked cake in the paths of the nocturnal elves, who, she imagined,
had plotted to steal her grandson from the mother&rsquo;s bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the traditions of the Isle of Man we obtain the exact counterpart
of Welsh legends respecting the Fairies visiting houses to wash
themselves.&nbsp; I will give the <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>following quotation from <i>Brand</i>, vol.
ii., p. 494, on this point:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Manks confidently assert that the first inhabitants of their
island were Fairies, and that these little people have still their
residence among them.&nbsp; They call them <i>the good people</i>, and say
they live in wilds and forests, and on mountains, and shun great cities
because of the wickedness acted therein.&nbsp; All the houses are blessed
where they visit for they fly vice.&nbsp; A person would be thought
impudently profane who should suffer his family to go to bed without having
first set a tub, or pail full of clean water for the guests to bathe
themselves in, which the natives aver they constantly do, as soon as the
eyes of the family are closed, wherever they vouchsafe to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several instances have already been given of the intercourse of Fairies
with mortals.&nbsp; In some parts of Wales it is or was thought that they
were even so familiar as to borrow from men.&nbsp; I will give one such
tale, taken from the <i>North Wales Chronicle</i> of March 19th, 1887.</p>
<h4><i>A Fairy Borrowing a Gridiron</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The following Fairy legend was told to Mr. W. W. Cobb, of Hilton
House, Atherstone, by Mrs. Williams, wife of Thomas Williams, pilot, in
whose house he lodged when staying in Anglesey:&mdash;Mary Roberts, of
Newborough, used to receive visits once a week from a little woman who used
to bring her a loaf of bread in return for the loan of her gridiron
(gradell) for baking bread.&nbsp; The Fairy always told her not to look
after her when she left the house, but one day she transgressed, and took a
peep as the Fairy went away.&nbsp; The latter went straight to the
lake&mdash;Lake Rhosddu&mdash;near the house at Newborough, and plunged
into its waters, and disappeared.&nbsp; This took place about a century
ago.&nbsp; The house where Mary Roberts lived is still standing about 100
yards north of the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><i>Fairy Riches and Gifts</i>.</h4>
<p>The riches of the Fairies are often mentioned by the old people, and the
source of their wealth is variously given.&nbsp; An old man, who has
already been mentioned, John Williams, born about 1770, was of opinion that
the Fairies stole the money from bad rich people to give it to good poor
folk.&nbsp; This they were enabled to do, he stated, as they could make
themselves invisible.&nbsp; In a conversation which we once had on this
subject, my old friend posed me with this question, &ldquo;Who do you think
robbed . . . of his money without his knowledge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do
you think took . . . money only twenty years ago?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
the Fairies,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;for no one ever found out the
thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shakespeare, in <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, A. iii., S. 1,
gives a very different source to the Fairy riches:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will give thee Fairies to attend on thee,<br />
And they <i>shall fetch thee jewels from the deep</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without inquiring too curiously into the source of these riches, it
shall now be shown how, and for what services, they were bestowed on
mortals.&nbsp; Gratitude is a noble trait in the Fairy character, and
favours received they ever repaid.&nbsp; But the following stories
illustrate alike their commiseration, their caprice, and their grateful
bounty.</p>
<h4><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span><i>The Fairies Placing Money on the Ground for a Poor
Man</i>.</h4>
<p>The following tale was told me by Thomas Jones, a small mountain farmer,
who occupies land near Pont Petrual, a place between Ruthin and
Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr.&nbsp; Jones informed me that he was acquainted
with all the parties mentioned in the tale.&nbsp; His story was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>A shoemaker, whose health would not permit him to pursue his own trade,
obtained work in a tanyard at Penybont, near Corwen.&nbsp; The shoemaker
lived in a house called Ty&rsquo;n-y-graig, belonging to Clegir isa
farm.&nbsp; He walked daily to his employment, a distance of several miles,
because he could not afford to pay for lodgings.&nbsp; One day, he noticed
a round bit of green ground, close to one of the gates on Tan-y-Coed farm,
and going up to it discovered a piece of silver lying on the sward.&nbsp;
Day after day, from the same spot, he picked up a silver coin.&nbsp; By
this means, as well as by the wage he received, he became a well-to-do
man.&nbsp; His wife noticed the many new coins he brought home, and
questioned him about them, but he kept the secret of their origin to
himself.&nbsp; At last, however, in consequence of repeated inquiries, he
told her all about the silver pieces, which daily he had picked up from the
green plot.&nbsp; The next day he passed the place, but there was no
silver, as in days gone by, and he never discovered another shilling,
although he looked for it every day.&nbsp; The poor man did not live long
after he had informed his wife whence he had obtained the bright silver
coins.</p>
<h4><i>The Fairies and their Chest of Gold</i>.</h4>
<p>The following tale I obtained from the Rev. Owen Jones, Vicar of
Pentrevoelas.&nbsp; The scene lies amongst the wildest mountains of
Merionethshire.</p>
<p>David, the weaver, lived in a house called Llurig, near <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Cerniogau Mawr,
between Pentrevoelas and Cerrig-y-Drudion.&nbsp; One day David was going
over the hill to Bala.&nbsp; On the top of the Garn two Fairies met him,
and desired him to follow them, promising, if he would do so, that they
would show him a chest filled with gold, and furthermore, they told him
that the gold should be his.&nbsp; David was in want of money, and he was
therefore quite willing to follow these good natured Fairies.&nbsp; He
walked many miles with them across the bleak, bare mountain, and at last,
descending from the summit, they reached a deep secluded glen, lying at the
foot of the mountain, and there the Fairies exposed to his view a chest,
which had never before been seen by mortal eye, and they informed him that
it was his.&nbsp; David was delighted when he heard the good news, and
mentally bade farewell to weaving.&nbsp; He knew, though, from tradition,
that he must in some way or other, there and then, take possession of his
treasure, or it would disappear.&nbsp; He could not carry the chest away,
as it was too heavy, but to show his ownership thereto he thrust his
walking stick into the middle of the gold, and there it stood erect.&nbsp;
Then he started homewards, and often and again, as he left the glen, he
turned round to see whether the Fairies had taken his stick away, and with
it the chest; but no, there it remained.&nbsp; At last the ridge hid all
from view, and, instead of going on to Bala, he hastened home to tell his
good wife of his riches.&nbsp; Quickly did he travel to his cottage, and
when there it was not long before his wife knew all about the chest of
gold, and where it was, and how that David had taken possession of his
riches by thrusting his walking stick into the middle of the gold.&nbsp; It
was too late for them to set out to carry the chest home, but they arranged
to start before the sun was up the next day.&nbsp; David, well acquainted
with Fairy doings, cautioned his wife not to tell anyone of their good
fortune, &ldquo;For, if you <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we shall vex the
Fairies, and the chest, after all, will not be ours.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
promised to obey, but alas, what woman possesses a silent tongue!&nbsp; No
sooner had the husband revealed the secret to his wife than she was
impatient to step to her next door neighbour&rsquo;s house, just to let
them know what a great woman she had all at once become.&nbsp; Now, this
neighbour was a shrewd miller, called Samuel.&nbsp; David went out, to
attend to some little business, leaving his wife alone, and she, spying her
opportunity, rushed to the miller&rsquo;s house, and told him and his wife
every whit, and how that she and David had arranged to go for the chest
next morning before the sun was up.&nbsp; Then she hurried home, but never
told David where she had been, nor what she had done.&nbsp; The good couple
sat up late that night, talking over their good fortune and planning their
future.&nbsp; It was consequently far after sunrise when they got up next
day, and when they reached the secluded valley, where the chest had been,
it had disappeared, and with it David&rsquo;s stick.&nbsp; They returned
home sad and weary, but this time there was no visit made to the
miller&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Ere long it was quite clearly seen that Samuel
the miller had come into a fortune, and David&rsquo;s wife knew that she
had done all the mischief by foolishly boasting of the Fairy gift, designed
for her husband, to her early rising and crafty neighbour, who had
forestalled David and his wife, and had himself taken possession of the
precious chest.</p>
<h4><i>The Fairy Shilling</i>.</h4>
<p>The Rev. Owen Jones, Pentrevoelas, whom I have already mentioned as
having supplied me with the Folk-lore of his parish, kindly gave me the
following tale:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was a clean, tidy, hardworking woman, who was most particular
about keeping her house in order.&nbsp; She had <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>a place for everything,
and kept everything in its place.</p>
<p>Every night, before retiring to rest, she was in the habit of brushing
up the ashes around the fire place, and putting a few fresh peat on the
fire to keep it in all night, and she was careful to sweep the floor before
going to bed.&nbsp; It was a sight worth seeing to see her clean
cottage.&nbsp; One night the Fairies, in their rambles, came that way and
entered her house.&nbsp; It was just such a place as they liked.&nbsp; They
were delighted with the warm fire, the clean floor and hearth, and they
stayed there all night and enjoyed themselves greatly.&nbsp; In the
morning, on leaving, they left a bright new shilling on the hearthstone for
the woman.&nbsp; Night after night, they spent in this woman&rsquo;s
cottage, and every morning she picked up a new shilling.&nbsp; This went on
for so long a time that the woman&rsquo;s worldly condition was much
improved.&nbsp; This her neighbours with envy and surprise perceived, and
great was their talk about her.&nbsp; At last it was noticed that she
always paid for the things she bought with new shilling pieces, and the
neighbours could not make out where she got all these bright shillings
from.&nbsp; They were determined, if possible, to ascertain, and one of
their number was deputed to take upon her the work of obtaining from the
woman the history of these new shillings.&nbsp; She found no difficulty
whatever in doing so, for the woman, in her simplicity, informed her gossip
that every morning the coin was found on the hearthstone.&nbsp; Next
morning the woman, as usual, expected to find a shilling, but never
afterwards did she discover one, and the Fairies came no more to her house,
for they were offended with her for divulging the secret.</p>
<p>This tale is exactly like many others that may be heard related by old
people, in many a secluded abode, to their grandchildren.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>A
lesson constantly inculcated by Fairy tales is this&mdash;Embrace
opportunities as they occur, or they will be lost for ever.&nbsp; The
following stories have reference to this belief.</p>
<h4><i>The Hidden Golden Chair</i>.</h4>
<p>It is a good many years since Mrs. Mary Jones, Corlanau, Llandinorwig,
Carnarvonshire, told me the following tale.&nbsp; The scene of the story is
the unenclosed mountain between Corlanau, a small farm, and the hamlet,
Rhiwlas.&nbsp; There is still current in those parts a tale of a hidden
golden chair, and Mrs. Jones said that it had once been seen by a young
girl, who might have taken possession of it, but unfortunately she did not
do so, and from that day to this it has not been discovered.&nbsp; The tale
is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was once a beautiful girl, the daughter of poor hardworking
parents, who held a farm on the side of the hill, and their handsome
industrious daughter took care of the sheep.&nbsp; At certain times of the
year she visited the sheep-walk daily, but she never went to the mountain
without her knitting needles, and when looking after the sheep she was
always knitting stockings, and she was so clever with her needles that she
could knit as she walked along.&nbsp; The Fairies who lived in those
mountains noticed this young woman&rsquo;s good qualities.&nbsp; One day,
when she was far from home, watching her father&rsquo;s sheep, she saw
before her a most beautiful golden chair.&nbsp; She went up to it and found
that it was so massive that she could not move it.&nbsp; She knew the
Fairy-lore of her neighbourhood, and she understood that the Fairies had,
by revealing the chair, intended it for her, but there she was on the wild
mountain, far away from home, without anyone near to assist her in carrying
it away.&nbsp; And often had she heard that such treasures were to be taken
possession of at once, or they would disappear for ever.&nbsp; She did not
know what to do, <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>but all at once she thought, if she could by
attaching the yarn in her hand to the chair connect it thus with her home,
the chair would be hers for ever.&nbsp; Acting upon this suggestion she
forthwith tied the yarn to the foot of the chair, and commenced unrolling
the ball, walking the while homewards.&nbsp; But long before she could
reach her home the yarn in the ball was exhausted; she, however, tied it to
the yarn in the stocking which she had been knitting, and again started
towards her home, hoping to reach it before the yarn in the stocking would
be finished, but she was doomed to disappointment, for that gave out before
she could arrive at her father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; She had nothing else
with her to attach to the yarn.&nbsp; She, however, could now see her home,
and she began to shout, hoping to gain the ear of her parents, but no one
appeared.&nbsp; In her distress she fastened the end of the yarn to a large
stone, and ran home as fast as she could.&nbsp; She told her parents what
she had done, and all three proceeded immediately towards the stone to
which the yarn had been tied, but they failed to discover it.&nbsp; The
yarn, too, had disappeared.&nbsp; They continued a futile search for the
golden chair until driven away by the approaching night.&nbsp; The next day
they renewed their search, but all in vain, for the girl was unable to find
the spot where she had first seen the golden chair.&nbsp; It was believed
by everybody that the Fairies had not only removed the golden chair, but
also the yarn and stone to which the yarn had been attached, but people
thought that if the yarn had been long enough to reach from the chair to
the girl&rsquo;s home then the golden chair would have been hers for
ever.</p>
<p>Such is the tale.&nbsp; People believe the golden chair is still hidden
away in the mountain, and that some day or other it will be given to those
for whom it is intended.&nbsp; But it is, they say, no use anyone looking
for it, as it is not to be got <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>by searching, but it will be revealed, as if by
accident, to those fated to possess it.</p>
<h4><i>Fairy treasures seen by a Man near Ogwen Lake</i>.</h4>
<p>Another tale, similar to the preceding one, is told by my friend, Mr.
Hugh Derfel Hughes, in his Hynafiaethau Llandegai a Llanllechid, pp. 35,
36.&nbsp; The following is a translation of Mr. Hughes&rsquo;s
story:&mdash;</p>
<p>It is said that a servant man penetrated into the recesses of the
mountains in the neighbourhood of Ogwen Lake, and that he there discovered
a cave within which there was a large quantity of brazen vessels of every
shape and description.&nbsp; In the joy of his heart at his good fortune,
he seized one of the vessels, with the intention of carrying it away with
him, as an earnest that the rest likewise were his.&nbsp; But, alas, it was
too heavy for any man to move.&nbsp; Therefore, with the intention of
returning the following morning to the cave with a friend to assist him in
carrying the vessels away, he closed its month with stones, and thus he
securely hid from view the entrance to the cave.&nbsp; When he had done
this it flashed upon his mind that he had heard of people who had
accidentally come across caves, just as he had, but that they, poor things,
had afterwards lost all traces of them.&nbsp; And lest a similar misfortune
should befall him, he determined to place a mark on the mouth of the cave,
which would enable him to come upon it again, and also he bethought himself
that it would be necessary, for further security, to indicate by some marks
the way from his house to the cave.&nbsp; He had however nothing at hand to
enable him to carry out this latter design, but his walking stick.&nbsp;
This he began to chip with his knife, and he placed the chips at certain
distances all along the way homewards.&nbsp; In this way he cut up his
staff, and he was satisfied with what he had done, for he hoped to find the
cave by means of <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>the chips.&nbsp; Early the next morning he and
a friend started for the mountain in the fond hope of securing the
treasures, but when they arrived at the spot where the chip-marked pathway
ought to begin, they failed to discover a single chip, because, as it was
reported&mdash;&ldquo;They had been gathered up by the
Fairies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus this vision was in vain.</p>
<p>The author adds to the tale these words:&mdash;&ldquo;But, reader,
things are not always to be so.&nbsp; There is a tradition in the Nant,
that a Gwyddel is to have these treasures and this is how it will come to
pass.&nbsp; A Gwyddel Shepherd will come to live in the neighbourhood, and
on one of his journeys to the mountain to shepherd his sheep, when fate
shall see fit to bring it about, there will run before him into the cave a
black sheep with a speckled head, and the Gwyddel shepherd will follow it
into the cave to catch it, and on entering, to his great astonishment, he
will discover the treasures and take possession of them.&nbsp; And in this
way it will come to pass, in some future age, that the property of the
Gwyddelod will return to them.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>The Fairies giving Money to a Man for joining them in their
Dance</i>.</h4>
<p>The following story came to me through the Rev. Owen Jones, Vicar of
Pentrevoelas.&nbsp; The occurrence is said to have taken place near
Pentrevoelas.&nbsp; The following are the particulars:&mdash;</p>
<p>Tomas Moris, Ty&rsquo;n-y-Pant, returning home one delightful summer
night from Llanrwst fair, came suddenly upon a company of Fairies dancing
in a ring.&nbsp; In the centre of the circle were a number of speckled
dogs, small in size, and they too were dancing with all their might.&nbsp;
After the dance came to an end, the Fairies persuaded Tomas to accompany
them to Hafod Bryn Mullt, and there the dance <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>was resumed, and did
not terminate until the break of day.&nbsp; Ere the Fairies departed they
requested their visitor to join them the following night at the same place,
and they promised, if he would do so, to enrich him with gifts of money,
but they made him promise that he would not reveal to any one the place
where they held their revels.&nbsp; This Tomas did, and night after night
was spent pleasantly by him in the company of his merry newly-made
friends.&nbsp; True to their word, he nightly parted company with them,
laden with money, and thus he had no need to spend his days as heretofore,
in manual labour.&nbsp; This went on as long as Tomas Moris kept his word,
but alas, one day, he divulged to a neighbour the secret of his
riches.&nbsp; That night, as usual, he went to Hafod Bryn Mullt, but his
generous friends were not there, and he noticed that in the place where
they were wont to dance there was nothing but cockle shells.</p>
<p>In certain parts of Wales it was believed that Fairy money, on close
inspection, would be found to be cockle shells.&nbsp; Mrs. Hugh Jones,
Corlanau, who has already been mentioned, told the writer that a man found
a crock filled, as he thought when he first saw it, with gold, but on
taking it home he discovered that he had carried home from the mountain
nothing but cockle shells.&nbsp; This Mrs. Jones told me was Fairy
money.</p>
<h4><i>The Fairies rewarding a Woman for taking care of their Dog</i>.</h4>
<p>Mention has already been made of Fairy Dogs.&nbsp; It would appear that
now and again these dogs, just like any other dogs, strayed from home; but
the Fairies were fond of their pets, and when lost, sought for them, and
rewarded those mortals who had shown kindness to the animals.&nbsp; For the
following tale I am indebted to the Rev. Owen Jones.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>One day when going home from Pentrevoelas Church, the wife of
Hafod y Gareg found on the ground in an exhausted state a Fairy dog.&nbsp;
She took it up tenderly, and carried it home in her apron.&nbsp; She showed
this kindness to the poor little thing from fear, for she remembered what
had happened to the wife of Bryn Heilyn, who had found one of the Fairy
dogs, but had behaved cruelly towards it, and consequently had fallen down
dead.&nbsp; The wife of Hafod y Gareg therefore made a nice soft bed for
the Fairy dog in the pantry, and placed over it a brass pot.&nbsp; In the
night succeeding the day that she had found the dog, a company of Fairies
came to Hafod y Gareg to make inquiries after it.&nbsp; The woman told them
that it was safe and sound, and that they were welcome to take it away with
them.&nbsp; She willingly gave it up to its masters.&nbsp; Her conduct
pleased the Fairies greatly, and so, before departing with the dog, they
asked her which she would prefer, a clean or a dirty cow?&nbsp; Her answer
was, &ldquo;A dirty one.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it came to pass that from that
time forward to the end of her life, her cows gave more milk than the very
best cows in the very best farms in her neighbourhood.&nbsp; In this way
was she rewarded for her kindness to the dog, by the Fairies.</p>
<h3>FAIRY MONEY TURNED TO DROSS.</h3>
<p>Fairies&rsquo; treasure was of uncertain value, and depended for its
very existence on Fairy intentions.&nbsp; Often and again, when they had
lavishly bestowed money on this or that person, it was discovered to be
only leaves or some equally worthless substance; but people said that the
recipients of the money richly deserved the deception that had been played
upon them by the Fairies.</p>
<p>In this chapter a few tales shall be given of this trait of Fairy
mythology.</p>
<h4><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>1.&nbsp; <i>A Cruel Man and a Fairy Dog</i>.</h4>
<p>The person from whom the following tale was derived was David Roberts,
Tycerrig, Clocaenog, near Ruthin.</p>
<p>A Fairy dog lost its master and wandered about here and there seeking
him.&nbsp; A farmer saw the dog, and took it home with him, but he behaved
very unkindly towards the wee thing, and gave it little to eat, and shouted
at it, and altogether he showed a hard heart.&nbsp; One evening a little
old man called at this farmer&rsquo;s house, and inquired if any stray dog
was there.&nbsp; He gave a few particulars respecting the dog, and
mentioned the day that it had been lost.&nbsp; The farmer answered in the
affirmative, and the stranger said that the dog was his, and asked the
farmer to give it up to him.&nbsp; This the farmer willingly did, for he
placed no value on the dog.&nbsp; The little man was very glad to get
possession of his lost dog, and on departing he placed a well filled purse
in the farmer&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Some time afterwards the farmer looked
into the purse, intending to take a coin out of it, when to his surprise
and annoyance he found therein nothing but leaves.</p>
<p>Roberts told the writer that the farmer got what he deserved, for he had
been very cruel to the wee dog.</p>
<p>Another tale much like the preceding one, I have heard, but I have
forgotten the source of the information.&nbsp; A person discovered a lost
Fairy dog wandering about, and took it home, but he did not nurse the
half-starved animal, nor did he nourish it.&nbsp; After a while some of the
Fairy folk called on this person to inquire after their lost dog, and he
gave it to them.&nbsp; They rewarded this man for his kindness with a pot
filled with money and then departed.&nbsp; On further inspection, the money
was found to be cockle shells.</p>
<p>Such lessons as these taught by the Fairies were not without their
effect on people who lived in days gone by.</p>
<h4><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>2.&nbsp; <i>Dick the Fiddler and the Fairy Crown-Piece</i>.</h4>
<p>For the following story I am indebted to my friend, Mr Hamer, who
records it in his &ldquo;Parochial account of Llanidloes,&rdquo; published
in the <i>Montgomeryshire Collections</i>, vol. x., pp. 252-3-4.&nbsp; Mr
Hamer states that the tale was related to him by Mr. Nicholas Bennett,
Glanrafon, Trefeglwys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick the Fiddler was in the habit of going about the country to
play at merry-makings, fairs, etc.&nbsp; This worthy, after a week&rsquo;s
<i>fuddle</i> at Darowen, wending his way homeward, had to walk down
&lsquo;Fairy Green Lane,&rsquo; just above the farmstead of Cefn Cloddiau,
and to banish fear, which he felt was gradually obtaining the mastery over
him, instead of whistling, drew out from the skirt pocket of his
long-tailed great coat his favourite instrument.&nbsp; After tuning it, be
commenced elbowing his way through his favourite air, <i>Aden Ddu&rsquo;r
Fran</i> (the Crow&rsquo;s Black Wing).&nbsp; When he passed over the green
sward where the <i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>, or Fairies, held their merry
meetings, he heard something rattle in his fiddle, and this something
continued rattling and tinkling until he reached Llwybr Scriw Riw, his
home, almost out of his senses at the fright caused by that everlasting
&lsquo;tink, rink, jink,&rsquo; which was ever sounding in his ears.&nbsp;
Having entered the cottage he soon heard music of a different kind, in the
harsh angry voice of his better half, who justly incensed at his absence,
began lecturing him in a style, which, unfortunately, Dick, from habit,
could not wholly appreciate.&nbsp; He was called a worthless fool, a
regular drunkard and idler.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is it possible for me to beg
enough for myself and half a house-full of children nearly naked, while you
go about the country and bring me nothing home.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush,
hush, my good woman,&rsquo; said Dick, &lsquo;see what&rsquo;s in the
blessed old fiddle.&rsquo;&nbsp; She obeyed, shook it, and out tumbled, to
their great surprise, a five-shilling piece.&nbsp; The wife looked <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>up into
the husband&rsquo;s face, saw that it was &lsquo;as pale as a sheet&rsquo;
with fright: and also noting that he had such an unusually large sum in his
possession, she came to the conclusion that he could not live long, and
accordingly changed her style saying, &lsquo;Good man go to Llanidloes
to-morrow, it is market-day and buy some shirting for yourself, for it may
never be your good fortune to have such a sum of money again.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The following day, according to his wife&rsquo;s wishes, Dick wended his
way to Llanidloes, musing, as he went along, upon his extraordinary luck,
and unable to account for it.&nbsp; Arrived in the town, he entered Richard
Evans&rsquo;s shop, and called for shirting linen to the value of five
shillings, for which he gave the shopkeeper the crown piece taken out of
the fiddle.&nbsp; Mr. Evans placed it in the till, and our worthy Dick
betook himself to Betty Brunt&rsquo;s public-house (now known as the
Unicorn) in high glee with the capital piece of linen in the skirt pocket
of his long-tailed top coat.&nbsp; He had not, however, been long seated
before Mr. Evans came in, and made sharp enquiries as to how and where he
obtained possession of the crown piece with which he had paid for the
linen.&nbsp; Dick assumed a solemn look, and then briefly related where and
how he had received the coin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say you so,&rsquo; said Evans,
&lsquo;I thought as much, for when I looked into the till, shortly after
you left the shop, to my great surprise it was changed into a heap of musty
horse dung.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>FAIRIES WORKING FOR MEN.</h3>
<p>It was once thought that kind Fairies took compassion on good folk, who
were unable to accomplish in due time their undertakings, and finished in
the night these works for them; and it was always observed that the Fairy
workman excelled as a tradesman the mortal whom he assisted.&nbsp; Many an
industrious shoemaker, it is said, has ere this <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>found in the morning
that the Fairies had finished in the night the pair of shoes which he had
only commenced the evening before.&nbsp; Farmers too, who had in part
ploughed a field, have in the morning been surprised to find it
finished.&nbsp; These kind offices, it was firmly believed, were
accomplished by Fairy friends.</p>
<p>Milton in <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> alludes to this belief in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tells how the drudging Goblin swet,<br />
To earn his cream-bowl duly set,<br />
When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,<br />
His shadowy flail hath thresh&rsquo;d the corn,<br />
That ten day-labourers could not end.</p>
<p>MILTON, <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>, lines 105-9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Scotland the sprite, or Fairy, called Browny, haunted family abodes,
and did all manner of work in the night for those who treated him
kindly.&nbsp; In England, Robin Goodfellow was supposed to perform like
functions.&nbsp; Thus sings Robin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet now and then, the maids to please,<br />
&nbsp;  At midnight I card up their wooll;<br />
And while they sleepe, and take their ease,<br />
&nbsp;  With wheel to threads their flax I pull.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grind at mill<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their malt up still;<br />
&nbsp;  I dress their hemp, I spin their tow.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any &rsquo;wake.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And would me take,<br />
&nbsp;  I wend me, laughing, ho, ho, ho!</p>
<p><i>Percy&rsquo;s Reliques</i>, vol. iii., p. 169.</p>

<p>Welsh Fairies are not described as ordinarily inclined to lessen
men&rsquo;s labours by themselves undertaking them; but there are a few
tales current of their having assisted worthy persons in their manual
works.&nbsp; Professor Rhys records one of these stories in <i>Y
Cymmrodor</i>, vol. iv. 210.&nbsp; He writes thus:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;One day Guto, the Farmer of Corwrion, complained to his
wife that he was in need of men to mow his hay, and she answered,
&lsquo;Why fret about it? look yonder! there you have a field full of them
at it, and stripped to their shirt sleeves.&rsquo;&nbsp; When he went to
the spot the sham workmen of the Fairy family had disappeared.&nbsp; This
same Guto, or somebody else, happened another time to be ploughing, when he
heard some person he could not see calling out to him, &lsquo;I have got
the <i>bins</i> (that is the <i>vice</i>) of my plough broken.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bring it to me,&rsquo; said the driver of Guto&rsquo;s team,
&lsquo;that I may mend it.&rsquo;&nbsp; When they brought the furrow to an
end, there they found the broken vice, and a barrel of beer placed near
it.&nbsp; One of the men sat down and mended it.&nbsp; Then they made
another furrow, and when they returned to the spot they found there a
two-eared dish, filled to the brim with <i>bara a chwrw</i>, or bread and
beer.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>FAIRY DANCES.</h3>
<p>The one occupation of the Fairy folk celebrated in song and prose was
dancing.&nbsp; Their green rings, circular or ovoidal in form, abounded in
all parts of the country, and it was in these circles they were said to
dance through the livelong night.&nbsp; In &ldquo;<i>C&acirc;n y Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i>,&rdquo; or the Fairies&rsquo; Song, thus they
chant:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O&rsquo;r glaswellt glen a&rsquo;r rhedyn m&acirc;n,<br />
&nbsp;  Gyfeillion dyddan, dewch,<br />
E ddarfu&rsquo;r nawn&mdash;mae&rsquo;r lloer yu llawn,<br />
&nbsp;  Y nos yn gyflawn gewch;<br />
O&rsquo;r chwarau sydd ar dwyn y dydd,<br />
&nbsp;  I&rsquo;r Dolydd awn ar daith.<br />
Nyni sydd lon, ni chaiff gerbron,<br />
&nbsp;  Farwolion ran o&rsquo;n gwaith.</p>
<p><i>Yr Hynafion Cymraeg</i>, p. 153.</p>
<p>From grasses bright, and bracken light,<br />
&nbsp;  Come, sweet companions, come,<br />
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>The
full moon shines, the sun declines,<br />
&nbsp;  We&rsquo;ll spend the night in fun;<br />
With playful mirth, we&rsquo;ll trip the earth,<br />
&nbsp;  To meadows green let&rsquo;s go,<br />
We&rsquo;re full of joy, without alloy,<br />
&nbsp;  Which mortals may not know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spots where the Fairies held their nightly revels were preserved
from intrusion by traditional superstitions.&nbsp; The farmer dared not
plough the land where Fairy circles were, lest misfortune should overtake
him.&nbsp; Thus were these mythical beings left in undisturbed possession
of many fertile plots of ground, and here they were believed to dance
merrily through many a summer night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canu, canu, drwy y nos,<br />
Dawnsio, dawnsio, ar waen y rhos,<br />
Yn ngoleuni&rsquo;r lleuad dlos;<br />
&nbsp;  Hapus ydym ni!</p>
<p>Pawb o honom sydd yn llon,<br />
Heb un gofid dan ei fron:<br />
Canu, dawnsio, ar y ton&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;  Dedwydd ydym ni!</p>
<p>Singing, singing, through the night,<br />
Dancing, dancing, with our might,<br />
Where the moon the moor doth light:<br />
&nbsp;  Happy ever we!</p>
<p>One and all of merry mien,<br />
Without sorrow are we seen,<br />
Singing, dancing on the green:<br />
&nbsp;  Gladsome ever we!</p>
<p><i>Professor Rhys&rsquo;s Fairy Tales</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words correctly describe the popular opinion of Fairy dance and
song, an opinion which reached the early part of the present century.</p>
<p>Since so much has reached our days of Fairy song and dance, it is not
surprising that we are told that the beautiful Welsh melody, <i>Toriad y
Dydd</i>, or the Dawn of Day, is the <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>work of a Fairy
minstrel, and that this song was chanted by the Fairy company just as the
pale light in the east announced the approach of returning day.</p>
<p>Chaucer (1340 c. to 1400 c.), alluding to the Fairies and their dances,
in his &lsquo;Wife of Bath&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In olde dayes of King Artour,<br />
Of which the Bretons speken gret honour,<br />
All was this lond ful-filled of Faerie;<br />
The elf-quene with hire joly compagnie<br />
Danced ful oft in many a grene mede.<br />
This was the old opinion as I rede;<br />
I speke of many hundred yeres ago;<br />
But now can no man see non elves mo.</p>
<p>Tyrwhitt&rsquo;s Chaucer i., p. 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the days of the Father of English poets, the elves had disappeared,
and he speaks of &ldquo;many hundred yeres ago,&rdquo; when he says that
the Fairy Queen and her jolly company danced full often in many a green
meadow.</p>
<p>Number 419 of the Spectator, published July 1st, 1712, states that
formerly &ldquo;every large common had a circle of Fairies belonging to
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here again the past is spoken of, but in Wales it would
seem that up to quite modern days some one, or other, was said to have seen
the Fairies at their dance, or had heard of some one who had witnessed
their gambols.&nbsp; Robert Roberts, Tycerrig, Clocaenog, enumerated
several places, such as Nantddu, Clocaenog, Craig-fron-Bannog, on Mynydd
Hiraethog, and Fron-y-Go, Llanfwrog, where the Fairies used to hold their
revels, and other places, such as Moel Fammau, have been mentioned as being
Fairy dancing ground.&nbsp; Many an aged person in Wales will give the name
of spots dedicated to Fairy sports.&nbsp; Information of this kind is
interesting, for it shows how long lived traditions are, and in a manner,
places associated with the Fair Tribe bring these mysterious beings right
to our doors.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>I
will now relate a few tales of mortals witnessing or joining in Fairy
dances.</p>
<p>The first was related to me by David Roberts.&nbsp; The scene of the
dance was the hill side by Pont Petrual between Ruthin and
Cerrig-y-Drudion.</p>
<h4>1.&nbsp; <i>A Man who found himself on a Heap of Ferns after joining in
a Fairy Dance</i>.</h4>
<p>A man who went to witness a Fairy dance was invited to join them.&nbsp;
He did so, and all night long he greatly enjoyed himself.&nbsp; At the
break of day the company broke up, and the Fairies took their companion
with them.&nbsp; The man found himself in a beautiful hall with everything
he could desire at his command, and here he pleasantly passed the time ere
he retired to rest.&nbsp; In the morning when he awoke, instead of finding
himself on a couch in Fairy Hall, be found himself lying on a heap of fern
on the wild mountain side.</p>
<p>Although somewhat unfortunate, this man fared better than most men who
joined the Fairy dances.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; <i>The Fairies threw dust into a Man&rsquo;s Eyes who Saw them
Dance</i>.</h4>
<p>This tale is taken from <i>Cymru Fu</i>, p. 176, and is from the pen of
<i>Glasynys</i>.&nbsp; I give it in English.</p>
<p>William Ellis, of Cilwern, was once fishing in Llyn Cwm Silin on a dark
cloudy day, when he observed close by, in the rushes, a great number of
men, or beings in the form of men, about a foot high, jumping and
singing.</p>
<p>He watched them for hours, and he never heard in all his life such
singing.&nbsp; But William went too near them, and they threw some kind of
dust into his eyes, and whilst he was rubbing his eyes, the little family
disappeared and fled somewhere out of sight and never afterwards was Ellis
able to get a sight of them.</p>
<p><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>The next tale <i>Glasynys</i> shall relate in his own words.&nbsp;
It appears in <i>Cymru Fu</i> immediately after the one just related.</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp; <i>A Man Dancing with the Fairies for Three Days</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Y mae chwedl go debyg am le o&rsquo;r enw Llyn-y-Ffynonau.&nbsp;
Yr oedd yno rasio a dawnsio, a thelynio a ffidlo enbydus, a gwas o Gelli
Ffrydau a&rsquo;i ddau gi yn eu canol yn neidio ac yn prancio mor sionc
&acirc; neb.&nbsp; Buont wrthi hi felly am dridiau a theirnos, yn

mae&rsquo;n ddiddadl y buasai i&rsquo;r creadur gwirion ddawnsio &rsquo;i
hun i farwolaeth.&nbsp; Ond gwaredwyd of y tro hwn.&rdquo;&nbsp; This in
English is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a tale somewhat like the preceding one told in
connection with a place called Llyn-y-Ffynonau.&nbsp; There was there
racing and dancing, and harping and furious fiddling, and the servant man
of Gelli Ffrydau with his two dogs in their midst jumping and dancing like
mad.&nbsp; There they were for three days and three nights without a break
dancing as if for very life, and were it not that there lived near by a
conjuror, who knew how things were going on, without a doubt the poor
creature would have danced himself to death.&nbsp; But he was spared this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next tale I received from Mr. David Lloyd, schoolmaster,
Llanfihangel-Glyn-Myfyr, and he heard it in that parish.</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>A Harper and the Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>There once lived in a remote part of Denbighshire, called Hafod Elwy, an
old harper, named Shon Robert, who used to be invited to parties to play
for the dancers, or to accompany the singers.&nbsp; One evening he went to
Llechwedd Llyfn, in the neighbourhood of Cefn Brith, to hold a merry
meeting, <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>and it was late before the lads and lasses separated.&nbsp; At
last the harper wended his way homeward.&nbsp; His path was over the bare
mountain.&nbsp; As he came near a lake called Llyndau-ychain, he saw on its
verge a grand palace, vividly illuminated.&nbsp; He was greatly surprised
at the sight, for he had never seen such a building there before.&nbsp; He,
however, proceeded on his way, and when he came in front of this beautiful
palace he was hailed by a footman, and invited to enter.&nbsp; He accepted
the invitation, and was ushered into a magnificent room, where a grand ball
was being held.&nbsp; The guests surrounded the harper and became very
friendly, and, to his wonder, addressed him by name.&nbsp; This hall was
magnificently furnished.&nbsp; The furniture was of the most costly
materials, many things were made of solid gold.&nbsp; A waiter handed him a
golden cup filled with sparkling wine, which the harper gladly
quaffed.&nbsp; He was then asked to play for the company, and this he did
to the manifest satisfaction of the guests.&nbsp; By and by one of the
company took Shon Robert&rsquo;s hat round and collected money for the
harper&rsquo;s benefit, and brought it back to him filled with silver and
gold.&nbsp; The feast was carried on with great pomp and merriment until
near the dawn of day, when, one by one, the guests disappeared, and at last
Shon was left alone.&nbsp; Perceiving a magnificent couch near, he laid
himself thereon, and was soon fast asleep.&nbsp; He did not awake until
mid-day, and then, to his surprise, he found himself lying on a heap of
heather, the grand palace had vanished away, and the gold and silver, which
he had transferred from his hat the night before into his bag, was changed
to withered leaves.</p>
<p>The following tale told me by the Rev. R. Jones shows that those who
witness a Fairy dance know not how time passes.</p>
<h4><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>5.&nbsp; <i>A Three Hours Fairy Dance seeming as a Few
Minutes</i>.</h4>
<p>The Rev. R. Jones&rsquo;s mother, when a young unmarried woman, started
one evening from a house called Tyddyn Heilyn, Penrhyndeudraeth, to her
home, Penrhyn isaf, accompanied by their servant man, David Williams,
called on account of his great strength and stature, Dafydd Fawr, Big
David.&nbsp; David was carrying home on his back a flitch of bacon.&nbsp;
The night was dark, but calm.&nbsp; Williams walked somewhat in the rear of
his young mistress, and she, thinking he was following, went straight
home.&nbsp; But three hours passed before David appeared with the pork on
his back.</p>
<p>He was interrogated as to the cause of his delay, and in answer said he
had only been about three minutes after his young mistress.&nbsp; He was
told that she had arrived three hours before him, but this David would not
believe.&nbsp; At length, however, he was convinced that he was wrong in
his time, and then he proceeded to account for his lagging behind as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>He observed, he said, a brilliant meteor passing through the air, which
was followed by a ring or hoop of fire, and within this hoop stood a man
and woman of small size, handsomely dressed.&nbsp; With one arm they
embraced each other, and with the other they took hold of the hoop, and
their feet rested on the concave surface of the ring.&nbsp; When the hoop
reached the earth these two beings jumped out of it, and immediately
proceeded to make a circle on the ground.&nbsp; As soon as this was done, a
large number of men and women instantly appeared, and to the sweetest music
that ear ever heard commenced dancing round and round the circle.&nbsp; The
sight was so entrancing that the man stayed, as he thought, a few minutes
to witness the scene.&nbsp; The ground all around was lit up by a kind of
subdued light, <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>and he observed every movement of these beings.&nbsp; By and by
the meteor which had at first attracted his attention appeared again, and
then the fiery hoop came to view, and when it reached the spot where the
dancing was, the lady and gentleman who had arrived in it jumped into the
hoop, and disappeared in the same manner in which they had reached the
place.&nbsp; Immediately after their departure the Fairies vanished from
sight, and the man found himself alone and in darkness, and then he
proceeded homewards.&nbsp; In this way he accounted for his delay on the
way.</p>
<p>In Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s <i>British Goblins</i>, pp. 79-81, is a graphic
account of a mad dance which Tudur ap Einion Gloff had with the Fairies, or
Goblins, at a place called Nant-yr-Ellyllon, a hollow half way up the hill
to Castell Dinas Bran, in the neighbourhood of Llangollen.&nbsp; All night,
and into the next day, Tudur danced frantically in the Nant, but he was
rescued by his master, who understood how to break the spell, and release
his servant from the hold the Goblins had over him!&nbsp; This he did by
pronouncing certain pious words, and Tudur returned home with his
master.</p>
<p>Mr. Evan Davies, carpenter, Brynllan, Efenechtyd, who is between seventy
and eighty years old, informed the writer that his friend John Morris told
him that he had seen a company of Fairies dancing, and that they were the
handsomest men and women that he had ever seen.&nbsp; It was night and
dark, but the place on which the dance took place was strangely
illuminated, so that every movement of the singular beings could be
observed, but when the Fairies disappeared it became suddenly quite
dark.</p>
<p>Although from the tales already given it would appear that the Fairies
held revelry irrespective of set times of meeting, still it was thought
that they had special days for their great banquets, and the eve of the
first of May, old <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>style, was one of these days, and another was
<i>Nos Wyl Ifan</i>, St. John&rsquo;s Eve, or the evening of June 23rd.</p>
<p>Thus sings <i>Glasynys</i>, in <i>Y Brython</i>, vol. iii. p.
270:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Nos Wyl Ifan</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i> yn lluoedd llawen,<br />
O dan nodded tawel Dwynwen,<br />
Welir yn y c&ecirc;l encilion,<br />
Yn perori mwyn alawon,<br />
Ac yn taenu hyd y twyni,<br />
Ac ar leiniau&rsquo;r deiliog lwyni,<br />
<i>Hud a Lledrith</i> ar y glesni,<br />
Ac yn sibrwd dwyfol desni!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am indebted to my friend Mr Richard Williams, F.R.H.S., Newtown,
Montgomeryshire, for the following translation of the preceding Welsh
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fairy Tribe in merry crowds,<br />
Under Dwynwen&rsquo;s calm protection,<br />
Are seen in shady retreats<br />
Chanting sweet melodies,<br />
And spreading over the bushes<br />
And the leafy groves<br />
Illusion and phantasy on all that is green,<br />
And whispering their mystic lore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May-day dances and revelling have reached our days, and probably they
have, like the Midsummer Eve&rsquo;s festivities, their origin in the far
off times when the Fairy Tribe inhabited Britain and other countries, and
to us have they bequeathed these Festivals, as well as that which ushers in
winter, and is called in Wales, <i>Nos glan gaua</i>, or All Hallow
Eve.&nbsp; If so, they have left us a legacy for which we thank them, and
they have also given us a proof of their intelligence and love of
nature.</p>
<p>But I will now briefly refer to Fairy doings on <i>Nos Wyl Ifan</i> as
recorded by England&rsquo;s greatest poet, and, further on, I shall have
more to say of this night.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Shakespeare introduces into his <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream</i> the prevailing opinions respecting Fairies in England, but they
are almost identical with those entertained by the people of Wales; so much
so are they British in character, that it is no great stretch of the
imagination to suppose that he must have derived much of his information
from an inhabitant of Wales.&nbsp; However, in one particular, the
poet&rsquo;s description of the Fairies differs from the more early opinion
of them in Wales.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s Fairies are, to a degree,
diminutive; they are not so small in Wales.&nbsp; But as to their habits in
both countries they had much in common.&nbsp; I will briefly allude to
similarities between English and Welsh Fairies, confining my remarks to
Fairy music and dancing.</p>
<p>To begin, both danced in rings.&nbsp; A Fairy says to Puck:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I serve the Fairy Queen<br />
To dew her orbs upon the green.</p>
<p><i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Act II., S I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And allusion is made in the same play to these circles in these
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you will patiently dance in our round<br />
And see our moonlight revels, go with us.</p>
<p>Act II., S. I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again Welsh and English Fairies frequented like spots to hold their
revels on.&nbsp; I quote from the same play:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now they never meet in grove or green,<br />
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen.</p>
<p>Act II., S. I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And never since the middle summer&rsquo;s spring<br />
Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead<br />
By paved fountain or by rushy brook<br />
Or by the beached margent of the sea,<br />
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind.</p>
<p>Act II., S. I</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>And further the Fairies in both countries meet at night, and hold
their Balls throughout the hours of darkness, and separate in early
morn.&nbsp; Thus Puck addressing Oberon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fairy King, attend and hark;<br />
I do hear the morning lark.</p>
<p>Act IV., S. I.</p>
<p>Now until the break of day<br />
Through this house each Fairy stray<br />
.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp;  .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br />
.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp;  .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br />
Trip away, make no stay,<br />
Meet we all at break of day.</p>
<p>Act V., S. I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Welsh tales given of Fairy dances the music is always spoken of
as most entrancing, and Shakespeare in felicitous terms gives utterance to
the same thought&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Music, lo! music, such as charmeth sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am indebted to the courtesy of the Rev. R. O. Williams, M.A., Vicar of
Holywell, for the following singular testimony to Fairy dancing.&nbsp; The
writer was the Rev. Dr. Edward Williams, at one time of Oswestry, and
afterwards Principal of the Independent Academy at Rotherham in Yorkshire,
who was born at Glan Clwyd, Bodfari, Nov. 14th, 1750, and died March 9,
1813.&nbsp; The extract is to be seen in the autobiography of Dr. Williams,
which has been published, but the quotation now given is copied from the
doctor&rsquo;s own handwriting, which now lies before me.</p>
<p>It may be stated that Mr. Wirt Sikes, in his <i>British Goblins</i>,
refers to the Dwarfs of Cae Caled, Bodfari, as Knockers, but he was not
justified, as will be seen from the extract, in thus describing them.&nbsp;
For the sake of reference the incident shall be called&mdash;The Elf
Dancers of Cae Caled.</p>
<h4><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span><i>The Elf Dancers of Cae Caled</i>.</h4>
<p>Dr. Edward Williams, under the year 1757, writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now going to relate a circumstance in this young period of
my life which probably will excite an alternate smile and thoughtful
reflection, as it has often done in myself, however singular the fact and
strong the evidence of its authenticity, and, though I have often in mature
age called to my mind the principles of religion and philosophy to account
for it, I am forced to class it among my <i>unknowables</i>.&nbsp; And yet
I may say that not only the fact itself, but also the consideration of its
being to my own mind inexplicable, has afforded some useful reflections,
with which this relation need not be accompanied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a fine summer day (about midsummer) between the hours of 12 at
noon and one, my eldest sister and myself, our next neighbour&rsquo;s
children Barbara and Ann Evans, both older than myself, were in a field
called Cae Caled near their house, all innocently engaged at play by a
hedge under a tree, and not far from the stile next to that house, when one
of us observed on the middle of the field a company of&mdash;what shall I
call them?&mdash;<i>Beings</i>, neither men, women, nor children, dancing
with great briskness.&nbsp; They were full in view less than a hundred
yards from us, consisting of about seven or eight couples: we could not
well reckon them, owing to the briskness of their motions and the
consternation with which we were struck at a sight so unusual.&nbsp; They
were all clothed in red, a dress not unlike a military uniform, without
hats, but their heads tied with handkerchiefs of a reddish colour, sprigged
or spotted with yellow, all uniform in this as in habit, all tied behind
with the corners hanging down their backs, and white handkerchiefs in their
hands held loose by the corners.&nbsp; They <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>appeared of a size
somewhat less than our own, but more like dwarfs than children.&nbsp; On
the first discovery we began, with no small dread, to question one another
as to what they could be, as there were no soldiers in the country, nor was
it the time for May dancers, and as they differed much from all the human
beings we had ever seen.&nbsp; Thus alarmed we dropped our play, left our
station, and made for the stile.&nbsp; Still keeping our eyes upon them we
observed one of their company starting from the rest and making towards us
with a running pace.&nbsp; I being the youngest was the last at the stile,
and, though struck with an inexpressible panic, saw the <i>grim elf</i>
just at my heels, having a full and clear, though terrific view of him,
with his ancient, swarthy, and grim complexion.&nbsp; I screamed out
exceedingly; my sister also and our companions set up a roar, and the
former dragged me with violence over the stile on which, at the instant I
was disengaged from it, this warlike Lilliputian leaned and stretched
himself after me, but came not over.&nbsp; With palpitating hearts and loud
cries we ran towards the house, alarmed the family, and told them our
trouble.&nbsp; The men instantly left their dinner, with whom still
trembling we went to the place, and made the most solicitous and diligent
enquiry in all the neighbourhood, both at that time and after, but never
found the least vestige of any circumstance that could contribute to a
solution of this remarkable phenomenon.&nbsp; Were any disposed to question
the sufficiency of this quadruple evidence, the fact having been uniformly
and often attested by each of the parties and various and separate
examinations, and call it a childish deception, it would do them no harm to
admit that, comparing themselves with the scale of universal existence,
beings with which they certainly and others with whom it is possible they
may be surrounded every moment, they are <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>but children of a
larger size.&nbsp; I know but few less credulous than the relator, but he
is no Sadducee.&nbsp; &lsquo;He who hath delivered will yet
deliver.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. R. Prys Jones, B.A., kindly informs me that he has
several intelligent boys in his school, the Boys&rsquo; Board School,
Denbigh, from Bodfari, and to them he read the preceding story, but not one
of them had ever heard of it.&nbsp; It is singular that the story should
have died so soon in the neighbourhood that gave it birth.</p>
<h3>FAIRY TRICKS WITH MORTALS.</h3>
<p>It was formerly believed in Wales that the Fairies, for a little fun,
sportively carried men in mid air from place to place, and, having conveyed
them to a strange neighbourhood, left them to return to their homes as best
they could.&nbsp; Benighted travellers were ever fearful of encountering a
throng of Fairies lest they should by them be seized, and carried to a
strange part of the country.</p>
<p>Allusion is made to this freak of the Fairies in the
<i>Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. i., p. 348:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it seems that there was some reason to be apprehensive of
encountering these &lsquo;Fair people&rsquo; in a mist; for, although
allowed not to be maliciously disposed, they had a very inconvenient
practice of seizing an unwary pilgrim, and hurrying him through the air,
first giving him the choice, however, of travelling above wind, mid-wind,
or below wind.&nbsp; If he chose the former, he was borne to an altitude
somewhat equal to that of a balloon; if the latter, he had the full benefit
of all the brakes and briars in his way, his contact with which seldom
failed to terminate in his discomfiture.&nbsp; Experienced travellers,
therefore, always kept in mind the advice of Apollo to Phaeton (In medio
tutissimus ibis) and selected the middle course, which <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>ensured them a
pleasant voyage at a moderate elevation, equally removed from the branches
and the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This description of an aerial voyage of a hapless traveller through
Fairy agency corresponds with the popular faith in every particular, and it
would not have been difficult some sixty, or so, years back, to have
collected many tales in various parts of Wales of persons who had been
subjected to this kind of conveyance.</p>
<p>The first mention that I have been able to find of this Fairy prank is
in a small book of prose poetry called <i>Gweledigaeth Cwrs y Byd</i>, or
<i>Y Bardd Cwsg</i>, which was written by the Revd. Ellis Wynne (born
1670-1, died 1734), rector of Llanfair, near Harlech.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Visions of the Sleeping Bard&rdquo; were published in 1703, and in
the work appear many superstitions of the people, some of which shall by
and by be mentioned.</p>
<p>In the very commencement of this work, the poet gives a description of a
journey which he had made through the air with the Fairies.&nbsp;
Addressing these beings, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;Atolwg, lan gynnulleidfa, yr
wyf yn deall mai rhai o bell ydych, a gymmerwch chwi Fardd i&rsquo;ch plith
sy&rsquo;n chwennych trafaelio?&rdquo; which in English is&mdash;&ldquo;May
it please you, comely assembly, as I understand that you come from afar, to
take into your company a Bard who wishes to travel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s request is granted, and then he describes his aerial
passage in these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Codasant fi ar eu hysgwyddau, fel codi Marchog Sir; ac yna ymaith
&acirc; ni fel y gwynt, tros dai a thiroedd, dinasoedd a theyrnasoedd, a
moroedd a mynyddoedd, heb allu dal sylw ar ddim, gan gyflymed yr oeddynt yn
hedeg.&rdquo;&nbsp; This translated is:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They raised me on their shoulders, as they do a Knight of <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the
Shire, and away we went like the wind, over houses and fields, over cities
and kingdoms, over seas and mountains, but I was unable to notice
particularly anything, because of the rapidity with which they
flew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the poet writes of his own flight with the Fairies depicts the then
prevailing notions respecting aerial journeys by Fairy agencies, and they
bear a striking resemblance to like stories in oriental fiction.&nbsp; That
the belief in this form of transit survived the days of <i>Bardd Cwsg</i>
will be seen from the following tale related by my friend Mr. E. Hamer in
his Parochial Account of Llanidloes:&mdash;</p>
<h4><i>A Man Carried Through the Air by the Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;One Edward Jones, or &lsquo;Ned the Jockey,&rsquo; as he was
familiarly called, resided, within the memory of the writer, in one of the
roadside cottages a short distance from Llanidloes, on the Newtown
road.&nbsp; While returning home late one evening, it was his fate to fall
in with a troop of Fairies, who were not pleased to have their gambols
disturbed by a mortal.&nbsp; Requesting him to depart, they politely
offered him the choice of three means of locomotion, viz., being carried
off by a &lsquo;high wind, middle wind, or low wind.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
jockey soon made up his mind, and elected to make his trip through the air
by the assistance of a high wind.&nbsp; No sooner had he given his
decision, than he found himself whisked high up into the air and his senses
completely bewildered by the rapidity of his flight; he did not recover
himself till he came in contact with the earth, being suddenly dropped in
the middle of a garden near Ty Gough, on the Bryndu road, many miles
distant from the spot whence he started on his aerial journey.&nbsp; Ned,
when relating this story, would vouch for its genuineness in the most
solemn manner, and the person who narrated it to the writer brought forward
as a proof of its truth, &lsquo;that there <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>was not the slightest
trace of any person going into the garden while Ned was found in the middle
of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Montgomeryshire Collections, vol. x., p.
247.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamer records another tale much like the foregoing, but the one I
have given is a type of all such stories.</p>
<p>Fairy illusion and phantasy were formerly firmly believed in by the
inhabitants of Wales.&nbsp; Fairies were credited with being able to
deceive the eyesight, if not also the other senses of man.&nbsp; One
illustrative tale of this kind I will now record.&nbsp; Like stories are
heard in many parts.&nbsp; The following story is taken from <i>Y
Gordofigion</i>, p. 99, a book which has more than once been laid under
contribution.</p>
<h3>FAIRY ILLUSIONS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ryw dro yr oedd brodor o Nefyn yn dyfod adref o ffair Pwllheli,
ac wrth yr Efail Newydd gwelai <i>Inn</i> fawreddog, a chan ei fod yn
gwybod nad oedd yr un gwesty i fod yno, gofynodd i un o&rsquo;r gweision os
oedd ganddynt ystabl iddo roddi ei farch.&nbsp; Atebwyd yn
gadarnhaol.&nbsp; Rhoddwyd y march yn yr ystabl, ac aeth yntau i mewn
i&rsquo;r ty, gofynodd am <i>beint</i> o gwrw, ac ni chafodd erioed well
cwrw na&rsquo;r cwrw hwnw.&nbsp; Yn mhen ychydig, gofynodd am fyned i
orphwys, a chafodd hyny hefyd.&nbsp; Aeth i&rsquo;w orweddle, yr hwn ydoedd
o ran gwychder yn deilwng i&rsquo;r brenhin; ond wchw fawr! erbyn iddo
ddeffro, cafodd ei hun yn gorwedd ar ei hyd mewn tomen ludw, a&rsquo;r
ceffyl wedi ei rwymo wrth bolyn clawdd gwrysg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This in English is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time a native of
Nefyn was returning from Pwllheli fair, and when near Efail Newydd he saw a
magnificent Inn, and, as he knew that no such public-house was really
there, he went up to it and asked one of the servants whether they had a
stable where he could put up his horse.&nbsp; He was answered in the <!--
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>affirmative.&nbsp; The horse was placed in the stable, and the
man entered the house and asked for a pint of beer, which he thought was
the best he had ever drunk.&nbsp; After awhile he inquired whether he could
go to rest.&nbsp; This also was granted him, and he retired to his room,
which in splendour was worthy of the king.&nbsp; But alas! when he awoke he
found himself sleeping on his back on a heap of ashes, and the horse tied
to a pole in the hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>FAIRY MEN CAPTURED.</h3>
<p>There are many tales current of wee Fairy men having been
captured.&nbsp; These tales are, however, evidently variants of the same
story.&nbsp; The dwarfs are generally spoken of as having been caught by a
trapper in his net, or bag, and the hunter, quite unconscious of the fact
that a Fairy is in his bag, proceeds homewards, supposing that he has
captured a badger, or some other kind of vermin, but, all at once, he hears
the being in the bag speak, and throwing the bag down he runs away in a
terrible fright.&nbsp; Such in short is the tale.&nbsp; I will proceed to
give several versions of this story.</p>
<h4>1.&nbsp; <i>Gwyddelwern Version</i>.</h4>
<p>The following tale was told by Mr. Evan Roberts, Ffridd Agored, a farmer
in the parish of Llanfwrog.&nbsp; Roberts heard the story when he was a
youth in the parish of Gwyddelwern.&nbsp; It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>A man went from his house for peat to the stack on the hill.&nbsp; As he
intended to carry away only a small quantity for immediate use, he took
with him a bag to carry it home.&nbsp; When he got to the hill he saw
something running before him, and he gave chase and caught it and bundled
it into the bag.&nbsp; He had not proceeded far on his way before he heard
a small voice shout somewhere near him, &ldquo;Neddy, Neddy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then he heard another small voice in the bag saying, &ldquo;There is
daddy calling me.&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner did <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the man hear these
words than in a terrible fright he threw the bag down, and ran home as fast
as he could.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; <i>The Llandrillo Version</i>.</h4>
<p>I am indebted for the following tale to Mr. E. S. Roberts, schoolmaster,
Llantysilio, near Llangollen:&mdash;</p>
<p>Two men whilst otter-hunting in Gwyn Pennant, Llandrillo, saw something
reddish scampering away across the ground just before them.&nbsp; They
thought it was an otter, and watching it saw that it entered a hole by the
side of the river.&nbsp; When they reached the place they found, underneath
the roots of a tree, two burrows.&nbsp; They immediately set to work to
catch their prey.&nbsp; Whilst one of the men pushed a long pole into one
of the burrows, the other held the mouth of a sack to the other, and very
shortly into the sack rushed their prey and it was secured.&nbsp; The men
now went homewards, but they had not gone far, ere they heard a voice in
the bag say, &ldquo;My mother is calling me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The frightened
men instantly threw the sack to the ground, and they saw a small man,
clothed in red, emerge therefrom, and the wee creature ran away with all
his might to the brushwood that grew along the banks of the river.</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp; <i>The Snowdon Version</i>.</h4>
<p>The following tale is taken from <i>Y Gordofigion</i>, p. 98:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aeth trigolion ardaloedd cylchynol y Wyddfa un tro i hela pryf
llwyd.&nbsp; Methasant a chael golwg ar yr un y diwrnod cyntaf; ond
cynllwynasant am un erbyn trannoeth, trwy osod sach a&rsquo;i cheg yn
agored ar dwll yr arferai y pryf fyned iddo, ond ni byddai byth yn dyfod
allan drwyddo am ei fod yn rhy serth a llithrig.&nbsp; A&rsquo;r modd a
gosodasant y sach oedd rhoddi cortyn trwy dyllau yn ei cheg, yn y fath fodd
ag y crychai, ac y ceuai ei cheg pan elai rhywbeth iddi.&nbsp; Felly fu;
aeth pawb i&rsquo;w fan, ac i&rsquo;w wely y noson hono.&nbsp; Gyda&rsquo;r
wawr bore dranoeth, awd i edrych y sach, ac erbyn <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>dyfod ati yr oedd ei
cheg wedi crychu, yn arwydd fod rhywbeth oddifewn.&nbsp; Codwyd hi, a
thaflodd un hi ar ei ysgwydd i&rsquo;w dwyn adref.&nbsp; Ond pan yn agos i
Bryn y Fedw wele dorpyn o ddynan bychan yn sefyll ar delpyn o graig gerllaw
ac yn gwaeddi, &lsquo;Meirig, wyt ti yna, dwad?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ydwyf,&rsquo; attebai llais dieithr (ond dychrynedig) o&rsquo;r
sach.&nbsp; Ar hyn, wele&rsquo;r helwyr yn dechreu rhedeg ymaith, a da oedd
ganddynt wneyd hyny, er gadael y sach i&rsquo;r pryf, gan dybied eu bod
wedi dal yn y sach un o ysbrydion y pwll diwaelod, ond deallasant ar ol
hyny mai un o&rsquo;r Tylwyth Teg oedd yn y sach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tale in English reads thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Once the people who lived
in the neighbourhood of Snowdon went badger-hunting.&nbsp; They failed the
first day to get sight of one.&nbsp; But they laid a trap for one by the
next day.&nbsp; This they did by placing a sack&rsquo;s open mouth with a
noose through it at the entrance to the badger&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; The
vermin was in the habit of entering his abode by one passage and leaving it
by another.&nbsp; The one by which he entered was too precipitous and
slippery to be used as an exit, and the trappers placed the sack in this
hole, well knowing that the running noose in the mouth of the sack would
close if anything entered.&nbsp; The next morning the hunters returned to
the snare, and at once observed that the mouth of the sack was tightly
drawn up, a sign that there was something in it.&nbsp; The bag was taken up
and thrown on the shoulders of one of the men to be carried home.&nbsp; But
when they were near Bryn y Fedw they saw a lump of a little fellow,
standing on the top of a rock close by and shouting, &lsquo;Meirig, are you
there, say?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; was the answer in a strange
but nervous voice.&nbsp; Upon this, the hunters, throwing down the bag,
began to run away, and they were glad to do so, although they had to leave
their <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>sack behind them, believing, as they did, that they had captured
one of the spirits of the bottomless pit.&nbsp; But afterwards they
understood that it was one of the Fairy Tribe that was in the
sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was at one time a tale much like this current in the parish of
Gyffylliog, near Ruthin, but in this latter case the voice in the bag said,
&ldquo;My father is calling me,&rdquo; though no one was heard to do
so.&nbsp; The bag, however, was cast away, and the trapper reported that he
had captured a Fairy!</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>The Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd Version</i>.</h4>
<p>Mr. Evan Davies, carpenter, Bryn Llan, Efenechtyd, told the writer that
Robert Jones, innkeeper, in the same parish, told him the following tale,
mentioning at the same time the man who figures in the narrative, whose
name, however, I have forgotten.&nbsp; The story runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>A man, wishing to catch a fox, laid a bag with its mouth open, but well
secured, at the entrance to a fox&rsquo;s den in Coed Cochion, Llanfair
Dyffryn Clwyd parish, and hid himself to await the result.&nbsp; He had
seen the fox enter its lair, and he calculated that it would ere long
emerge therefrom.&nbsp; By and by, he observed that something had entered
the bag, and going up to it, he immediately secured its mouth, and,
throwing the bag over his shoulder, proceeded homewards, but he had not
gone far on his way before he heard someone say, &ldquo;Where is my son
John?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man, however, though it was dark, was not
frightened, for he thought that possibly some one was in search of a lad
who had wandered from home.&nbsp; He was rather troubled to find that the
question was repeated time after time by some one who apparently was
following him.&nbsp; But what was his terror when, ere long, he heard a
small voice issue from the bag he was carrying, saying <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>&ldquo;There is dear
father calling me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man in a terrible fright threw the bag
down, and ran away as fast as his feet could carry him, and never stopped
until he reached his home, and when he came to himself he related the story
of his adventure in the wood to his wife.</p>
<h3>FAIRIES IN MARKETS AND FAIRS.</h3>
<p>It was once firmly believed by the Welsh that the Fairy Tribe visited
markets and fairs, and that their presence made business brisk.&nbsp; If
there was a buzz in the market place, it was thought that the sound was
made by the Fairies, and on such occasions the farmers&rsquo; wives
disposed quickly of their commodities; if, however, on the other hand,
there was no buzz, the Fairies were absent, and there was then no business
transacted.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Jones, Ty&rsquo;n-y-Wern, Bryneglwys, who, when a youth,
lived in Llanbedr parish, near Ruthin, informed the writer that his mother,
after attending a market at Ruthin, would return home occasionally with the
sad news that &ldquo;They were not there,&rdquo; meaning that the Fairies
were not present in the market, and this implied a bad market and no sweets
for Richard.&nbsp; On the other hand, should the market have been a good
one, she would tell them that &ldquo;They filled the whole place,&rdquo;
and the children always had the benefit of their presence.</p>
<p>This belief that the Fairies sharpened the market was, I think,
general.&nbsp; I find in <i>Y Gordofigion</i>, p. 97, the following
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Byddai y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g yn arfer myned i farchnadoedd y Bala,
ac yn gwneud twrw mawr heb i neb eu gweled, ac yr oedd hyny yn arwydd fod y
farchnad ar godi,&rdquo; which is:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Fairies were in the habit of frequenting Bala markets, and they made
a great noise, without any one seeing them, and this was a sign that the
market was sharpening.</p>
<h3><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>NAMES OF THINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FAIRIES.</h3>
<p>Many small stone utensils found in the ground, the use, or the origin,
of which was unknown to the finders, were formerly attributed to the
Fairies.&nbsp; Thus, flint arrow-heads were called elf shots, from the
belief that they once belonged to Elves or Fairies.&nbsp; And celts, and
other stone implements, were, by the peasants of Wales and other places,
ascribed to the same small folk.&nbsp; Very small clay pipes were also
attributed to the same people.&nbsp; All this is curious evidence of a
pre-existing race, which the Celts supplanted, and from whom, in many
respects, they differed.&nbsp; Although we cannot derive much positive
knowledge from an enumeration of the articles popularly associated with the
Fairies, still, such a list, though an imperfect one, will not be void of
interest.&nbsp; I will, therefore, describe certain pre-historic remains,
which have been attributed to the aboriginal people of Britain.</p>
<h4><i>Fairy Pipes</i>.</h4>
<p><i>Cetyn y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>, or Fairy Pipes, are small clay pipes,
with bowls that will barely admit the tip of the little finger.&nbsp; They
are found in many places, generally with the stem broken off, though
usually the bowl is perfect.</p>
<p>A short time ago I stayed awhile to talk with some workmen who were
engaged in carting away the remains of a small farm house, once called <i>Y
Bwlch</i>, in the parish of Efenechtyd, Denbighshire, and they told me that
they had just found a Fairy Pipe, or, as they called it, <i>Cetyn y Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i>, which they gave me.&nbsp; A similar pipe was also picked up
by Lewis Jones, Brynffynon, on Coed Marchan, in the same parish, when he
was enclosing a part of the mountain allotted to his farm.&nbsp; In March,
1887, the workmen employed in taking down what were at one time buildings
belonging to a bettermost kind of <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>residence, opposite
Llanfwrog Church, near Ruthin, also discovered one of these wee
pipes.&nbsp; Pipes, identical in shape and size, have been found in all
parts of Wales, and they are always known by the name of <i>Cetyn y Tylwyth
T&ecirc;g</i>, or Fairy Pipes.</p>
<p>In Shropshire they have also been discovered in the Fens, and the late
Rev. Canon Lee, Hanmer, had one in his possession, which had been found in
those parts, and, it was called a Fairy Pipe.</p>
<h4><i>Fairy Whetstone</i>.</h4>
<p>The small spindle whorls which belong to the stone age, and which have
been discovered in the circular huts, called <i>Cyttiau&rsquo;r
Gwyddelod</i>, which are the earliest remains of human abodes in Wales, are
by the people called Fairy Whetstones, but, undoubtedly, this name was
given them from their resemblance to the large circular whetstone at
present in common use, the finders being ignorant of the original use of
these whorls.</p>
<h4><i>Fairy Hammer and Fairy or Elf Stones</i>.</h4>
<p>Stone hammers of small size have been ascribed to the Fairies, and an
intelligent Welsh miner once told the writer that he had himself seen, in a
very ancient diminutive mine level, stone hammers which, he said, had once
belonged to the Fairies.</p>
<p>Other pre-historic implements, as celts, have been denominated Fairy
remains.&nbsp; Under this head will come flint, or stone arrow-heads.&nbsp;
These in Scotland are known by the name Elf Shots or Fairy Stones.</p>
<p>Pennant&rsquo;s <i>Tour in Scotland</i>, 1769, p. 115, has the following
reference to these arrow-heads:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Elf Shots</i>, i.e., the stone arrow-heads of the old
inhabitants of this island, are supposed to be weapons shot by Fairies at
cattle, to which are attributed any disorders they have.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Jamieson states in his Dictionary, under the heading Elf
Shot:&mdash;&ldquo;The <i>Elf Shot</i> or <i>Elfin Arrow</i> is still used
in the Highlands as an amulet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tradition, in thus connecting stone implements with the Fairies, throws
a dim light on the elfin community.&nbsp; But evidence is not wanting that
the Celts themselves used stone utensils.</p>
<p>The things which shall now be mentioned, as being connected with the
Fairies, owe their names to no foundation in fact, but are the offspring of
a fanciful imagination, and are attributed to the Fairies in agreement with
the more modern and grotesque notions concerning those beings and their
doings.&nbsp; This will be seen when it is stated that the Fox Glove
becomes a Fairy Glove, and the Mushroom, Fairy Food.</p>
<h4><i>Ymenyn y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g, or Fairy Butter</i>.</h4>
<p>I cannot do better than quote Pennant on this matter.&nbsp; His words
are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Petroleum, rock oil, or what the Welsh call it, <i>Ymenin tylwyth
t&ecirc;g</i>, or Fairies&rsquo; butter, has been found in the lime stone
strata in our mineral country.&nbsp; It is a greasy substance, of an
agreeable smell, and, I suppose, ascribed to the benign part of those
imaginary beings.&nbsp; It is esteemed serviceable in rheumatic cases,
rubbed on the parts affected.&nbsp; It retains a place in our
dispensary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pennant&rsquo;s <i>Whiteford</i>, p. 131.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Bwyd Ellyllon</i>, <i>or Goblins&rsquo; Food</i>.</h4>
<p>This was a kind of fungus or mushroom.&nbsp; The word is given in Dr.
Owen Pughe&rsquo;s dictionary under the head <i>Ellyll</i>.</p>
<h4><i>Menyg y Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>, <i>Or Fairy Gloves</i>.</h4>
<p>The Fox Glove is so called, but in Dr. Owen Pughe&rsquo;s dictionary,
under the head <i>Ellyll</i>, the Fox Glove is called <i>Menyg
Ellyllon</i>.</p>
<h4><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span><i>Yr Ellyll D&acirc;n</i>, <i>or Goblin Fire</i>.</h4>
<p>The Rev. T. H. Evans, in his <i>History of the Parish of Llanwddyn</i>,
states that in that parish &ldquo;Will of the Wisp&rdquo; is called
&ldquo;<i>Yr Ellyll D&acirc;n</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is indeed the common
name for the <i>Ignis fatuus</i> in most, if not in all parts of Wales, but
in some places where English is spoken it is better known by the English
term, &ldquo;Jack o&rsquo; Lantern,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jack y
Lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Rhaffau&rsquo;r Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>, <i>or the Ropes of the
Fairies</i>.</h4>
<p>Professor Rhys, in his Welsh Fairy Tales&mdash;<i>Y Cymmrodor</i> vol.
v., p. 75&mdash;says, that gossamer, which is generally called in North
Wales <i>edafedd gwawn</i>, or <i>gwawn</i> yarn, used to be called,
according to an informant, <i>Rhaffau&rsquo;r Tylwyth T&ecirc;g</i>, that
is to say, the Ropes of the Fair Family, thus associating the Fairies with
marshy, or rushy, places, or with ferns and heather as their dwelling
places.&nbsp; It was supposed that if a man lay down to sleep in such
places the Fairies would come and bind him with their ropes, and cover him
with a gossamer sheet, which would make him invisible, and incapable of
moving.</p>
<h3>FAIRY KNOCKERS, OR COBLYNAU.</h3>
<p>The <i>Coblynau</i> or <i>Knockers</i> were supposed to be a species of
Fairies who had their abode in the rocks, and whose province it was to
indicate by knocks, and other sounds, the presence of ore in mines.</p>
<p>It would seem that many people had dim traditions of a small race who
had their dwellings in the rocks.&nbsp; This wide-spread belief in the
existence of cave men has, in our days, been shown to have had a foundation
in fact, and many vestiges of this people have been revealed by intelligent
cave hunters.&nbsp; But the age in which the cave men lived cannot even
approximately be ascertained.&nbsp; In various <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>parts of Wales, in
the lime rock, their abodes have been brought to light.&nbsp; It is not
improbable that the people who occupied the caves of ancient days were, in
reality, the original Fairy Knockers.&nbsp; These people were invested, in
after ages, by the wonder-loving mind of man, with supernatural powers.</p>
<p>&AElig;schylus, the Greek tragic poet, who died in the 69th year of his
age, B.C. 456, in <i>Prometheus Vinctus</i>, refers to cave dwellers in a
way that indicates that even then they belonged to a dateless
antiquity.</p>
<p>In Prometheus&rsquo;s speech to the
chorus&mdash;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&epsilon;
&pi;&lambda;&iota;&upsilon;&theta;&upsilon;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; . .
&#941;&nu; &mu;&upsilon;&chi;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
&alpha;&nu;&eta;&lambda;&#943;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;&mdash;lines 458-461,
is a reference to this ancient tradition.&nbsp; His words, put into
English, are these:&mdash;&ldquo;And neither knew the warm brick-built
houses exposed to the sun, nor working in wood, <i>but they dwelt
underground</i>, like as little ants, <i>in the sunless recesses of
caves</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above quotation proves that the Greeks had a tradition that men in a
low, or the lowest state of civilization, had their abodes in caves, and
possibly the reference to ants would convey the idea that the cave dwellers
were small people.&nbsp; Be this as it may, it is very remarkable that the
word applied to a <i>dwarf</i> in the dialects of the northern countries of
Europe signifies also a <i>Fairy</i>, and the dwarfs, or Fairies, are there
said to inhabit the rocks.&nbsp; The following quotation from
Jamieson&rsquo;s <i>Scottish Dictionary</i> under the word <i>Droich</i>, a
dwarf, a pigmy, shows this to have been the case:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the northern dialects, <i>dwerg</i> does not merely signify a
dwarf, but also a <i>Fairy</i>!&nbsp; The ancient Northern nations, it is
said, prostrated themselves before rocks, believing that they were
inhabited by these pigmies, and that they thence gave forth oracles.&nbsp;
Hence they called the echo <i>dwergamal</i>, as believing it to be their
voice or speech. . .&nbsp; <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>They were accounted excellent artificers,
especially as smiths, from which circumstance some suppose that they have
received their name . . .&nbsp; Other Isl. writers assert that their
ancestors did not worship the pigmies as they did the <i>genii</i> or
spirits, also supposed to reside in the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Percy, in a letter to the Rev. Evan Evans (<i>Ieuan Prydydd
Hir</i>), writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I make no doubt but Fairies are derived from the
<i>Duergar</i>, or Dwarfs, whose existence was so generally believed among
all the northern nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>The Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. i., p. 331.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again in Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, vol. iii.,
p. 171, are these remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that our Saxon ancestors, long before they left
their German forests, believed in the existence of a kind of diminutive
demons, or middle species between men and spirits, whom they called
<i>Duergar</i>, or Dwarfs, and to whom they attributed wonderful
performances, far exceeding human art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pennant, in his <i>Tour in Scotland</i>, 1772, pp. 55-56, when
describing the collieries of Newcastle, describes the Knockers
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The immense caverns that lay between the pillars exhibited a most
gloomy appearance.&nbsp; I could not help enquiring here after the
imaginary inhabitant, the creation of the labourer&rsquo;s fancy,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The swart Fairy of the mine;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and was seriously answered by a black fellow at my elbow that he really
had never met with any, but that his grandfather had found the little
implements and tools belonging to this diminutive race of subterraneous
spirits.&nbsp; The Germans believed in two species; one fierce and
malevolent, the other a gentle race, appearing like little old men, dressed
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>like the miners, and not much above two feet high; these wander
about the drifts and chambers of the works, seem perpetually employed, yet
do nothing.&nbsp; Some seem to cut the ore, or fling what is cut into
vessels, or turn the windlass, but never do any harm to the miners, except
provoked; as the sensible Agricola, in this point credulous, relates in his
book, <i>de Animantibus Subterraneis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jamieson, under the word <i>Farefolkis</i>, writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Besides
the Fairies, which are more commonly the subject of popular tradition, it
appears that our forefathers believed in the existence of a class of
spirits under this name that wrought in the mines;&rdquo; and again,
quoting from a work dated 1658, the author of which says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In northerne kingdomes there are great armies of devils that have
their services which they perform with the inhabitants of these countries,
but they are most frequent in rocks and <i>mines</i>, where they break,
cleave, and make them hollow; which also thrust in pitchers and buckets,
and carefully fit wheels and screws, whereby they are drawn upwards; and
they show themselves to the labourers, when they list, like phantoms and
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preceding quotations from Pennant and Jamieson correspond with the
Welsh miners&rsquo; ideas of the <i>Coblynau</i>, or Knockers.&nbsp; There
is a difficulty in tracing to their origin these opinions, but, on the
whole, I am strongly inclined to say that they have come down to modern
times from that remote period when cave-men existed as a distinct
people.</p>
<p>But now let us hear what our Welsh miners have to say about the
<i>Coblynau</i>.&nbsp; I have spoken to several miners on this subject,
and, although they confessed that they had not themselves heard these good
little people at work, still they believed in their existence, and could
name mines in which they had been heard.&nbsp; I was told that they are
generally <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>heard at work in new mines, and that they lead the men to the ore
by knocking in its direction, and when the lode is reached the knocking
ceases.</p>
<p>But the following extracts from two letters written by Lewis Morris, a
well-known and learned Welshman, fully express the current opinion of
miners in Wales respecting Knockers.&nbsp; The first letter was written
Oct. 14, 1754, and the latter is dated Dec. 4, 1754.&nbsp; They appear in
Bingley&rsquo;s <i>North Wales</i>, vol. ii., pp. 269-272.&nbsp; Lewis
Morris writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who know very little of arts or sciences, or the powers of
nature (which, in other words, are the powers of the author of nature),
will laugh at us Cardiganshire miners, who maintain the existence of
<i>Knockers</i> in mines, a kind of good natured impalpable people not to
be seen, but heard, and who seem to us to work in the mines; that is to
say, they are the types or forerunners of working in mines, as dreams are
of some accidents, which happen to us.&nbsp; The barometer falls before
rain, or storms.&nbsp; If we do not know the construction of it, we should
call it a kind of dream that foretells rain; but we know it is natural, and
produced by natural means, comprehended by us.&nbsp; Now, how are we sure,
or anybody sure, but that our dreams are produced by the same natural
means?&nbsp; There is some faint resemblance of this in the sense of
hearing; the bird is killed before we hear the report of the gun.&nbsp;
However this is, I must speak well of the <i>Knockers</i>, for they have
actually stood my good friends, whether they are aerial beings called
spirits, or whether they are a people made of matter, not to be felt by our
gross bodies, as air and fire and the like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the discovery of the <i>Esgair y Mwyn</i> mine, these
little people, as we call them here, worked hard there day and night; and
there are abundance of honest, sober people, who have heard them, and some
persons who have no <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>notion of them or of mines either; but after
the discovery of the great ore they were heard no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I began to work at Llwyn Llwyd, they worked so fresh there
for a considerable time that they frightened some young workmen out of the
work.&nbsp; This was when we were driving levels, and before we had got any
ore; but when we came to the ore, they then gave over, and I heard no more
talk of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our old miners are no more concerned at hearing them
<i>blasting</i>, boring holes, landing <i>deads</i>, etc., than if they
were some of their own people; and a single miner will stay in the work, in
the dead of the night, without any man near him, and never think of any
fear or of any harm they will do him.&nbsp; The miners have a notion that
the <i>Knockers</i> are of their own tribe and profession, and are a
harmless people who mean well.&nbsp; Three or four miners together shall
hear them sometimes, but if the miners stop to take notice of them, the
<i>Knockers</i> will also stop; but, let the miners go on at their work,
suppose it is <i>boring</i>, the <i>Knockers</i> will at the same time go
on as brisk as can be in landing, <i>blasting</i>, or beating down the
<i>loose</i>, and they are always heard a little distance from them before
they come to the ore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are odd assertions, but they are certainly facts, though we
cannot, and do not pretend to account for them.&nbsp; We have now very good
ore at <i>Llwyn Llwyd</i>, where the <i>Knockers</i> were heard to work,
but have now yielded up the place, and are no more heard.&nbsp; Let who
will laugh, we have the greatest reason to rejoice, and thank the
<i>Knockers</i>, or rather God, who sends us these notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no time to answer your objection against <i>Knockers</i>;
I have a large treatise collected on that head, and <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>what Mr. Derham says
is nothing to the purpose.&nbsp; If sounds of voices, whispers, blasts,
working, or pumping, can be carried on a mile underground, they should
always be heard in the same place, and under the same advantages, and not
once in a month, a year, or two years.&nbsp; Just before the discovery of
ore last week, three men together in our work at <i>Llwyn Llwyd</i> were
ear-witnesses of <i>Knockers</i> pumping, driving a wheelbarrow, etc.; but
there is no pump in the work, nor any mine within less than a mile of it,
in which there are pumps constantly going.&nbsp; If they were these pumps
that they had heard, why were they never heard but that once in the space
of a year?&nbsp; And why are they not now heard?&nbsp; But the pumps make
so little noise that they cannot be heard in the other end of <i>Esgair y
Mwyn</i> mine when they are at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a dumb and deaf tailor in this neighbourhood who has a
particular language of his own by signs, and by practice I can understand
him, and make him understand me pretty well, and I am sure I could make him
learn to write, and be understood by letters very soon, for he can
distinguish men already by the letters of their names.&nbsp; Now letters
are marks to convey ideas, just after the same manner as the motion of
fingers, hands, eyes, etc.&nbsp; If this man had really seen ore in the
bottom of a sink of water in a mine, and wanted to tell me how to come at
it, he would take two sticks like a pump, and would make the motions of a
pumper at the very sink where he knew the ore was, and would make the
motions of driving a wheelbarrow.&nbsp; And what I should infer from thence
would be that I ought to take out the water and sink or drive in the place,
and wheel the stuff out.&nbsp; By parity of reasoning, the language of
<i>Knockers</i>, by imitating the sound of pumping, wheeling, etc.,
signifies that we should take out the water and drive there.&nbsp; <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>This is
the opinion of all old miners, who pretend to understand the language of
the <i>Knockers</i>.&nbsp; Our agent and manager, upon the strength of this
notice, goes on and expects great things.&nbsp; You, and everybody that is
not convinced of the being of <i>Knockers</i>, will laugh at these things,
for they sound like dreams; so does every dark science.&nbsp; Can you make
any illiterate man believe that it is possible to know the distance of two
places by looking at them?&nbsp; Human knowledge is but of small extent,
its bounds are within our view, we see nothing beyond these; the great
universal creation contains powers, etc., that we cannot so much as guess
at.&nbsp; May there not exist beings, and vast powers infinitely smaller
than the particles of air, to whom air is as hard a body as the diamond is
to us?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; There is neither great nor small, but by
comparison.&nbsp; Our <i>Knockers</i> are some of these powers, the
guardians of mines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the story in Selden&rsquo;s Table-Talk of Sir Robert
Cotton and others disputing about Moses&rsquo;s shoe.&nbsp; Lady Cotton
came in and asked, &lsquo;Gentlemen, are you sure it <i>is</i> a
shoe?&rsquo;&nbsp; So the first thing is to convince mankind that there is
a set of creatures, a degree or so finer than we are, to whom we have given
the name of <i>Knockers</i> from the sounds we hear in our mines.&nbsp;
This is to be done by a collection of their actions well attested, and that
is what I have begun to do, and then let everyone judge for
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preceding remarks, made by an intelligent and reliable person,
conversant with mines, and apparently uninfluenced by superstition, are at
least worthy of consideration.&nbsp; The writer of these interesting
letters states positively that sounds were heard; whether his attempt to
solve the cause of these noises is satisfactory, and conclusive, is open to
doubt.&nbsp; We must believe the facts asserted, although disagreeing <!--
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>with
the solution of the difficulty connected with the sounds.&nbsp; Miners in
all parts of England, Scotland, Wales, Germany, and other parts, believe in
the existence of <i>Knockers</i>, whatever these may be, and here, as far
as I am concerned, I leave the subject, with one remark only, which is,
that I have never heard it said that anyone in Wales ever <i>saw</i> one of
these <i>Knockers</i>.&nbsp; In this they differ from Fairies, who,
according to popular notions, have, time and again, been seen by mortal
eyes; but this must have been when time was young.</p>
<p>The writer is aware that Mr. Sikes, in his <i>British Goblins</i>, p.
28, gives an account of <i>Coblynau</i> or <i>Knockers</i> which he affirms
had been seen by some children who were playing in a field in the parish of
Bodfari, near Denbigh, and that they were dancing like mad, and terribly
frightened the children.&nbsp; But in the autobiography of Dr. Edward
Williams, already referred to, p. 98, whence Mr. Sikes derived his
information of the Dwarfs of Cae Caled, they are called
&ldquo;<i>Beings</i>,&rdquo; and not <i>Coblynau</i>.</p>
<p>Before concluding my remarks on Fairy Knockers I will give one more
quotation from Bingley, who sums up the matter in the following
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am acquainted with the subject only from report, but I can
assure my readers that I found few people in Wales that did not give full
credence to it.&nbsp; The elucidation of these extraordinary facts must be
left to those persons who have better opportunities of inquiring into them
than I have.&nbsp; I may be permitted to express a hope that the subject
will not be neglected, and that those who reside in any neighbourhood where
the noises are heard will carefully investigate their cause, and, if
possible, give to the world a more accurate account of them than the
present.&nbsp; In the year 1799 they were heard in some mines in the parish
of <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Llanvihangel Ysgeiviog, in Anglesea, where they continued, at
intervals, for some weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bingley&rsquo;s <i>North Wales</i>, vol. ii., p. 275.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, I may remark that in living miners&rsquo; days, as
already stated, Knockers have not been heard.&nbsp; Possibly Davy&rsquo;s
Safety Lamp and good ventilation have been their destruction.&nbsp; Their
existence was believed in when mining operations, such as now prevail, were
unknown, and their origin is to be sought for among the dim traditions that
many countries have of the existence of small cave men.</p>
<h4><i>The Pwka</i>, <i>or Pwca</i>.</h4>
<p>Another imaginary being, closely allied to the Fairy family, was the
<i>Pwka</i>.&nbsp; He seems to have possessed many of the mischievous
qualities of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Puck, whom, also, he resembled in name,
and it is said that the <i>Pwka</i>, in common with the <i>Brownie</i>, was
a willing worker.</p>
<p>The Rev. Edmund Jones in his <i>Book of Apparitions</i> gives an account
of one of these goblins, which visited the house of Job John Harry, who
lived at a place called the Trwyn, and hence the visitor is called
Pwka&rsquo;r Trwyn, and many strange tales are related of this
spirit.&nbsp; The writer of the <i>Apparitions</i> states that the spirit
stayed in Job&rsquo;s house from some time before Christmas until Easter
Wednesday.&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;&ldquo;At first it came knocking at the
door, chiefly by night, which it continued to do for a length of time, by
which they were often deceived, by opening it.&nbsp; At last it spoke to
one who opened the door, upon which they were much terrified, which being
known, brought many of the neighbours to watch with the family.&nbsp; T. E.
foolishly brought a gun with him to shoot the spirit, as he said, and sat
in the corner.&nbsp; As Job was coming home that night the spirit met him,
and told him that there was a man come to the house to shoot him,
&lsquo;but,&rsquo; said he, <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>&rsquo;thou shalt see how I will beat
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; As soon as Job was come to the house stones were thrown
at the man that brought the gun, from which he received severe blows.&nbsp;
The company tried to defend him from the blows of the stones, which did
strike him and no other person; but it was in vain, so that he was obliged
to go home that night, though it was very late; he had a great way to
go.&nbsp; When the spirit spoke, which was not very often, it was mostly
out of the oven by the hearth&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; He would sometimes in the
night make music with Harry Job&rsquo;s fiddle.&nbsp; One time he struck
the cupboard with stones, the marks of which were to be seen, if they are
not there still.&nbsp; Another time he gave Job a gentle stroke upon his
toe, when he was going to bed, upon which Job said, &lsquo;Thou art curious
in smiting,&rsquo; to which the spirit answered, &lsquo;I can smite thee
where I please.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were at length grown fearless and bold to
speak to it, and its speeches and actions were a recreation to them, seeing
it was a familiar kind of spirit which did not hurt them, and informed them
of some things which they did not know.&nbsp; One old man, more bold than
wise, on hearing the spirit just by him, threatened to stick him with his
knife, to which he answered, &lsquo;Thou fool, how can thou stick what thou
cannot see with thine eyes.&rsquo;&nbsp; The spirit told them that he came
from Pwll-y-Gaseg, <i>i.e</i>., Mare&rsquo;s Pit, a place so called in the
adjacent mountain, and that he knew them all before he came there. . .
.&nbsp; On Easter Wednesday he left the house and took his farewell in
these words:&mdash;&lsquo;Dos yn iack, Job,&rsquo; <i>i.e</i>.,
&lsquo;Farewell, Job,&rsquo; to which Job said, &lsquo;Where goest
thou?&rsquo;&nbsp; He was answered, &lsquo;Where God
pleases.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pwka was credited with maliciously leading benighted men
astray.&nbsp; He would appear with a lantern or candle in hand, some little
distance in front of the traveller, and without any exertion keep ahead of
him, and leading him <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>through rocky and dangerous places, would
suddenly, with an ironical laugh blow out the candle, and disappear, and
leave the man to his fate.</p>
<p>The following tale, taken from Croker&rsquo;s <i>Fairy Legends of
Ireland</i>, vol. ii., pp. 231-3, well illustrates this mischievous trait
in the character of the Pwka.&nbsp; The writer has seen the tale elsewhere,
but as it differs only slightly from that recorded by Croker, he gives it
in the words of this author.&nbsp; His words are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cwm Pwcca, or the Pwcca&rsquo;s Valley, forms part of the deep
and romantic glen of the Clydach, which, before the establishment of the
iron works of Messrs. Frere and Powell, was one of the most secluded spots
in Wales, and therefore well calculated for the haunt of goblins and
fairies; but the bustle of a manufactory has now in a great measure scared
these beings away, and of late it is very rarely that any of its former
inhabitants, the Pwccas, are seen.&nbsp; Such, however, is their attachment
to their ancient haunt, that they have not entirely deserted it, as there
was lately living near this valley a man who used to assert that he had
seen one, and had a narrow escape of losing his life, through the
maliciousness of the goblin.&nbsp; As he was one night returning home over
the mountain from his work, he perceived at some distance before him a
light, which seemed to proceed from a candle in a lantern, and upon looking
more attentively, he saw what he took to be a human figure carrying it,
which he concluded to be one of his neighbours likewise returning from his
work.&nbsp; As he perceived that the figure was going the same way with
himself, he quickened his pace in order that he might overtake him, and
have the benefit of his light to descend the steep and rocky path which led
into the valley; but he rather wondered that such a short person as
appeared to carry the lantern should be able to walk so <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>fast.&nbsp; However,
he re-doubled his exertions, determined to come up with him, and although
he had some misgivings that he was not going along the usual track, yet he
thought that the man with the lantern must know better than himself, and he
followed the direction taken by him without further hesitation.&nbsp;
Having, by dint of hard walking, overtaken him, he suddenly found himself
on the brink of one of the tremendous precipices of Cwm Pwcca, down which
another step would have carried him headlong into the roaring torrent
beneath.&nbsp; And, to complete his consternation, at the very instant he
stopped, the little fellow with the lantern made a spring right across the
glen to the opposite side, and there, holding up the light above his head,
turned round and uttered with all his might a loud and most malicious
laugh, upon which he blew out his candle, and disappeared up the opposite
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This spirit is also said to have assisted men in their labours, and
servant girls and servant men often had their arduous burdens lightened by
his willing hands.&nbsp; But he punished those who offended him in a
vindictive manner.&nbsp; The Pwka could hide himself in a jug of barm or in
a ball of yarn, and when he left a place, it was for ever.</p>
<p>In the next chapter I will treat of another phase of legendary lore,
which, although highly imaginative, seems to intimate that the people who
transmitted these tales had some knowledge, though an exaggerated one, of a
people and system which they supplanted.</p>
<h3>FAIRY, OR MYTHIC ANIMALS.</h3>
<p>From the Myddvai Legend it would appear that the Fairies possessed
sheep, cattle, goats, and horses, and from other tales we see that they had
dogs, etc.&nbsp; Their stock, therefore, was much like that of ordinary
farmers in our <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>days.&nbsp; But Fairy animals, like their
owners, have, in the course of ages, been endowed with supernatural
powers.&nbsp; In this chapter shall be given a short history of these
mythical animals.</p>
<h4><i>Cwn Annwn</i>, <i>or Dogs of the Abyss</i>.</h4>
<p>The words <i>Cwn Annwn</i> are variously translated as Dogs of Hell,
Dogs of Elfinland.&nbsp; In some parts of Wales they are called <i>Cwn
Wybir</i>, Dogs of the Sky, and in other places <i>Cwn Bendith Y
Mamau</i>.&nbsp; We have seen that &ldquo;<i>Bendith y Mamau</i>&rdquo; is
a name given to the Fairies, and in this way these dogs become Fairy
Dogs.</p>
<p>A description of these Fairy dogs is given in <i>Y Brython</i>, vol. iii
p. 22.&nbsp; Briefly stated it is as follows:&mdash;<i>Cwn Bendith y
Mamau</i> were a pack of small hounds, headed by a large dog.&nbsp; Their
howl was something terrible to listen to, and it foretold death.&nbsp; At
their approach all other dogs ceased barking, and fled before them in
terror, taking refuge in their kennels.&nbsp; The birds of the air stopped
singing in the groves when they heard their cry, and even the owl was
silent when they were near.&nbsp; The laugh of the young, and the talk at
the fireside were hushed when the dreadful howl of these Hell hounds was
heard, and pale and trembling with fear the inmates crowded together for
mutual protection.&nbsp; And what was worse than all, these dogs often
foretold a death in some particular family in the neighbourhood where they
appeared, and should a member of this family be in a public-house, or other
place of amusement, his fright would be so great that he could not move,
believing that already had death seized upon some one in his house.</p>
<p>The Fairy dogs howled more at Cross-roads, and such like public places,
than elsewhere.&nbsp; And woe betide any one who stood in their way, for
they bit them, and were likely even to drag a man away with them, and their
bite was often fatal.&nbsp; They collected together in huge numbers in the
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>churchyard where the person whose death they announced was to be
buried, and, howling around the place that was to be his grave, disappeared
on that very spot, sinking there into the earth, and afterwards they were
not to be seen.</p>
<p>A somewhat different description of <i>Cwn Annwn</i> is given in the
<i>Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. i., p. 350.&nbsp; Here we are told that
&ldquo;these terrific animals are supposed to be devils under the semblance
of hunting dogs . . . and they are usually accompanied by fire in some form
or other.&nbsp; Their appearance is supposed to indicate the death of some
friend or relative of the person to whom they shew themselves.&nbsp; They
have never been known to commit any mischief on the persons of either man
or woman, goat, sheep, or cow, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Motley&rsquo;s <i>Tales of the Cymry</i>, p. 58, that author
says:&mdash;&ldquo;I have met with but a few old people who still cherished
a belief in these infernal hounds which were supposed after death to hunt
the souls of the wretched to their allotted place of torment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, however, once firmly and generally believed, that these awful
creatures could be heard of a wild stormy night in full cry pursuing the
souls of the unbaptized and unshriven.&nbsp; Mr. Chapman, Dolfor, near
Newtown, Montgomeryshire, writes to me thus:&mdash;&ldquo;These mysterious
animals are never seen, only heard.&nbsp; A whole pack were recently heard
on the borders of Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; They went from the
Kerry hills towards the Llanbadarn road, and a funeral quickly followed the
same route.&nbsp; The sound was similar to that made by a pack of hounds in
full cry, but softer in tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Edmund Jones, in his work entitled &ldquo;An Account of
Apparitions of Spirits in the county of Monmouth,&rdquo; says that,
&ldquo;The nearer these dogs are to a man, the less their voice is, and the
farther the louder, and sometimes, <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>like the voice of a
great hound, or like that of a blood hound, a deep hollow
voice.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is needless to say that this gentleman believed
implicitly in the existence of <i>Cwn Annwn</i>, and adduces instances of
their appearance.</p>
<p>The following is one of his tales:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As Thomas Andrews was coming towards home one night with some
persons with him, he heard, as he thought, the sound of hunting.&nbsp; He
was afraid it was some person hunting the sheep, so he hastened on to meet,
and hinder them; he heard them coming towards him, though he saw them
not.&nbsp; When they came near him, their voices were but small, but
increasing as they went from him; they went down the steep towards the
river <i>Ebwy</i>, dividing between this parish and <i>Mynyddislwyn</i>,
whereby he knew they were what are called <i>Cwn wybir</i> (Sky dogs), but
in the inward part of Wales <i>Cwn Annwn</i> (Dogs of Hell).&nbsp; I have
heard say that these spiritual hunting-dogs have been heard to pass by the
eaves of several houses before the death of someone in the family.&nbsp;
Thomas Andrews was an honest, religious man, and would not have told an
untruth either for fear or for favour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The colour of these dogs is variously given, as white, with red ears,
and an old man informed Mr. Motley that their colour was blood-red, and
that they always were dripping with gore, and that their eyes and teeth
were of fire.&nbsp; This person confessed that he had never seen these
dogs, but that he described them from what he had heard.&mdash;<i>Tales of
the Cymry</i>, p. 60.&nbsp; There is in <i>The Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 271, another and more natural description of <i>Cwn Annwn</i>.&nbsp; It
is there stated that Pwyll, prince of Dyved, went out to hunt,
and:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He sounded his horn and began to enter upon the chase, following
his dogs and separating from his companions.&nbsp; <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>And, as he was
listening to the cry of his pack, he could distinctly hear the cry of
another pack, different from that of his own, and which was coming in an
opposite direction.&nbsp; He could also discern an opening in the wood
towards a level plain; and as his pack was entering the skirt of the
opening, he perceived a stag before the other pack, and about the middle of
the glade the pack in the rear coming up and throwing the stag on the
ground; upon this be fixed his attention on the colour of the pack without
recollecting to look at the stag; and, of all the hounds in the world he
had ever seen, he never saw any like them in colour.&nbsp; Their colour was
a shining clear white, with red ears; and the whiteness of the dogs, and
the redness of their ears, were equally conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are informed that these dogs belonged to Arawn, or the silver-tongued
King of Annwn, of the lower or southern regions.&nbsp; In this way these
dogs are identified with the creatures treated of in this chapter.&nbsp;
But their work was less weird than soul-hunting.</p>
<p>A superstition akin to that attached to <i>Cwn Annwn</i> prevails in
many countries, as in Normandy and Bretagne.&nbsp; In Devonshire, the Wish,
or Wisked Hounds, were once believed in, and certain places on Dartmoor
were thought to be their peculiar resort, and it was supposed that they
hunted on certain nights, one of which was always St. John&rsquo;s
Eve.&nbsp; These terrible creations of a cruel mind indicate a phase of
faith antagonistic to, and therefore more ancient than, Christianity.</p>
<p>With another quotation from <i>Tales of the Cymry</i> (p. 61-62), I will
conclude my remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the north of Devon the spectral pack are called Yesh hounds
and Yell hounds.&nbsp; There is another legend, evidently of Christian
origin, which represents them in <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>incessant pursuit of
a lost spirit.&nbsp; In the northern quarter of the moor the Wish hounds,
in pursuit of the spirit of a man who had been well known in the country,
entered a cottage, the door of which had been incautiously left open, and
ran round the kitchen, but quietly, without their usual cry.&nbsp; The
Sunday after the same man appeared in church, and the person whose house
the dogs had entered, made bold by the consecrated place in which they
were, ventured to ask why he had been with the Wish hounds.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why should not my spirit wander,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;as well
as another man&rsquo;s?&rsquo;&nbsp; Another version represents the hounds
as following the spirit of a beautiful woman, changed into the form of a
hare; and the reader will find a similar legend, with some remarkable
additions, in the Disquisitiones Magic&aelig; of the Jesuit Delrio, lib.
vi., c.2.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><i>The Fairy Cow</i>.</h4>
<p>There are many traditions afloat about a wonderful cow, that supplied
whole neighbourhoods with milk, which ceased when wantonly wasted.&nbsp; In
some parts of England this is called the Dun Cow; in Shropshire she becomes
also the <i>White Cow</i>; in Wales she is, <i>Y Fuwch Frech</i>, or <i>Y
Fuwch Gyfeiliorn</i>.&nbsp; This mystic cow has found a home in many
places.&nbsp; One of these is the wild mountain land between Llanfihangel
Glyn Myfyr and a hamlet called Clawdd Newydd about four miles from
Ruthin.&nbsp; About midway between these two places is a bridge called
Pontpetrual, and about half a mile from the bridge to the north is a small
mountain farm called <i>Cefn Bannog</i>, and near this farm, but on the
unenclosed mountain, are traces of primitive abodes, and it was here that,
tradition says, the <i>Fuwch Frech</i> had her home.&nbsp; But I will now
give the history of this strange cow as I heard it from the mouth of Thomas
Jones, Cefn Bannog.</p>
<h4><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span><i>Y Fuwch Frech</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Freckled Cow</i>.</h4>
<p>In ages long gone by, my informant knew not how long ago, a wonderful
cow had her pasture land on the hill close to the farm, called Cefn Bannog,
after the mountain ridge so named.&nbsp; It would seem that the cow was
carefully looked after, as indicated by the names of places bearing her
name.&nbsp; The site of the cow house is still pointed out, and retains its
name, <i>Preseb y Fuwch Frech</i>&mdash;the Crib of the Freckled Cow.&nbsp;
Close to this place are traces of a small enclosure called <i>Gwal Erw y
Fuwch Frech</i>, or the Freckled Cow&rsquo;s Meadow.&nbsp; There is what
was once a track way leading from the ruins of the cow house to a spring
called <i>Ffynon y Fuwch Frech</i>, or the Freckled Cow&rsquo;s Well, and
it was, tradition says, at this well that the cow quenched her
thirst.&nbsp; The well is about 150 yards from the cow house.&nbsp; Then
there is the feeding ground of the cow called, <i>Waen Banawg</i>, which is
about half a mile from the cow house.&nbsp; There are traces of walls
several feet thick in these places.&nbsp; The spot is a lonely one, but
ferns and heather flourish luxuriantly all about this ancient
homestead.&nbsp; It is also said that this cow was the mother of the
<i>Ychain Banawg</i>, or large-horned oxen.&nbsp; But now to proceed to the
tradition that makes the memory of this cow dear to the inhabitants of the
Denbighshire moorland.</p>
<p>Old people have transmitted from generation to generation the following
strange tale of the Freckled Cow.&nbsp; Whenever any one was in want of
milk they went to this cow, taking with them a vessel into which they
milked the cow, and, however big this vessel was, they always departed with
the pail filled with rich milk, and it made no difference, however often
she was milked, she could never be milked dry.&nbsp; This continued for a
long time, and glad indeed the people were to avail themselves of the
inexhaustible supply of <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>new milk, freely given to them all.&nbsp; At
last a wicked hag, filled with envy at the people&rsquo;s prosperity,
determined to milk the cow dry, and for this purpose she took a riddle with
her, and milked and milked the cow, until at last she could get no more
milk from her.&nbsp; But, sad to say, the cow immediately, upon this
treatment, left the country, and was never more seen.&nbsp; Such is the
local history of the Freckled Cow.</p>
<p>Tradition further states that she went straight to a lake four miles
off, bellowing as she went, and that she was followed by her two children
the <i>Dau Eidion Banawg</i>, the two long-horned oxen, to <i>Llyn dau
ychain</i>, the Lake of the Two Oxen, in the parish of Cerrig-y-drudion,
and that she entered the lake and the two long-horned oxen, bellowing
horribly, went, one on either side the lake, and with their mother
disappeared within its waters, and none were ever afterwards seen.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that tradition buries these celebrated cattle in this
lake, I find in a book published by Dr. John Williams, the father of the
Rev. John Williams, M.A., Vicar of Llanwddyn, in the year 1830, on the
&ldquo;Natural History of Llanrwst,&rdquo; the following statement.&nbsp;
The author in page 17, when speaking of <i>Gwydir</i>, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the middle court (which was once surrounded by the house),
there is a large bone, which appears to be the rib of some species of
whale, but according to the vulgar opinion, it is the rib of the Dun Cow
(<i>y Fuwch Frech</i>), killed by the Earl of Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be stated that Llanrwst is not many miles distant from
Cerrig-y-drudion and yet we have in these places conflicting traditions,
which I will not endeavour to reconcile.</p>
<p>The Shropshire tale of the Fairy Cow is much the same as the
preceding.&nbsp; There she is known as <i>The White Cow of </i><!-- page
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span><i>Mitchell&rsquo;s Fold</i>.&nbsp; This place is situated on the
Corndon Hill, a bare moorland in the extreme west of Shropshire.&nbsp; To
this day there is to be seen there a stone circle known as Mitchell&rsquo;s
Fold.</p>
<p>The story of the Shropshire Cow is this.&nbsp; There was a dire famine
in those parts, and the people depended for support on a beautiful white
cow, a Fairy cow, that gave milk to everybody, and it mattered not how many
came, there was always enough for all, and it was to be so, so long as
every one who came only took one pailful.&nbsp; The cow came night and
morning to be milked, and it made no difference what size the vessel was
that was brought by each person, for she always gave enough milk to fill
it, and all the other pails.&nbsp; At last, there came an old witch to
Mitchell&rsquo;s Fold, and in spite and malice she brought a riddle and
milked the cow into it; she milked and milked, and at last she milked her
dry, and after that the cow was never seen.&nbsp; Folk say she was turned
into a stone.</p>
<p>I am indebted to Miss Burne&rsquo;s <i>Shropshire Folk-Lore</i> for the
particulars above given.</p>
<p>A like tale is to be heard in Warwickshire, and also in Lancashire, near
Preston, where the Dun cow gave freely her milk to all in time of drought,
and disappeared on being subjected to the treatment of the Welsh and
Shropshire cow.</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd, Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, gave me a different tale of the
<i>Dau ychain Banawg</i> to that already related.&nbsp; His story is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4><i>The Legend of Llyn y ddau ychain</i>.</h4>
<p>The speckled cow had two calves, which, when they grew up, became strong
oxen.&nbsp; In those days there was a wicked spirit that troubled
Cerrig-y-drudion Church, and the people greatly feared this spirit, and
everybody was afraid, even in the day-time, to pass the church, for there,
day after day, <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>they saw the evil one looking out of the
church windows and grinning at them.&nbsp; They did not know what to do to
get rid of this spirit, but at last they consulted a famous conjuror, who
told them that no one could dislodge their enemy but the <i>Dau ychain
Banawg</i>.&nbsp; They knew of the two long-horned cattle which fed on Waen
Banawg.&nbsp; There, therefore, they went, and brought the powerful yoke to
the church.&nbsp; After considerable difficulty they succeeded in
dislodging the spirit, and in securing it to a sledge to which these oxen
were yoked, and now struggling to get free, he was dragged along by the
powerful oxen towards a lake on Hiraethog Mountain, but so ponderous was
their load and so fearful was the spirit&rsquo;s contentions that the
sledge ploughed the land between the church and the lake as they went
along, leaving in the course that they took deep furrows, and when they
came to the hill so terrible were the struggles of the oxen to get along
that the marks of their hoofs were left in the rocks where they may still
be seen.&nbsp; When at last they reached the lake the spirit would not
yield, and therefore oxen, sledge, and spirit were driven into the lake,
and thus was the country rid of the evil one, and hence the name of the
lake&mdash;the Lake of the Two Oxen&mdash;for the oxen likewise perished in
the lake.</p>
<p>The foregoing legend is evidently founded on the older and more obscure
story of Hu Gardarn, or Hu the Mighty, who with his <i>Dau ychain
Banawg</i> drew to land the <i>avanc</i> out of <i>Llyn Llion</i>, so that
the lake burst out no more to deluge the earth.&nbsp; For, be it known, it
was this <i>avanc</i> that had occasioned the flood.&nbsp; However, there
is a rival claimant for the honour of having destroyed the <i>avanc</i>,
whatever that might have been, for, in Hindu Mythology, Vishnu is credited
with having slain the monster that had occasioned the Deluge.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>This last bit of Folk-lore about Hu Gadarn, which is found in the
<i>Triads</i>, shows how widespread, and how very ancient, Welsh tales
are.&nbsp; Hu Gadarn is by some writers identified with Noah.&nbsp; He was
endowed, it would seem, with all the qualities of the gods of the Greeks,
Egyptians, and Orientals, and his name is applied by the Welsh poets of the
middle ages to the Supreme Being.</p>
<h4><i>Y Fuwch Gyfeiliorn</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Stray Cow</i>.</h4>
<p>The history of the Fairy Stray Cow appears in <i>Y Brython</i>, vol.
iii., pp. 183-4.&nbsp; The writer of the story states that he obtained his
materials from a Paper by the late Dr. Pugh, Penhelyg, Aberdovey.&nbsp; The
article alluded to by Gwilym Droed-ddu, the writer of the account in the
<i>Brython</i>, appeared in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for
1853, pp. 201-5.&nbsp; The tale, as given by Dr. Pugh, is reproduced by
Professor Rhys in his Welsh Fairy Tales, and it is much less embellished in
English than in Welsh.&nbsp; I will quote as much of the Doctor&rsquo;s
account as refers to the Stray Cow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shrewd old hill farmer (Thomas Abergroes by name), well skilled
in the folk-lore of the district, informed me that, in years gone by,
though when, exactly, he was too young to remember, those dames
(<i>Gwragedd Annwn</i>) were wont to make their appearance, arrayed in
green, in the neighbourhood of Llyn Barfog, chiefly at eventide,
accompanied by their kine and hounds, and that, on quiet summer nights in
particular, these ban-hounds were often to be heard in full cry, pursuing
their prey&mdash;the souls of doomed men dying without baptism and
penance&mdash;along the upland township of Cefnrhosucha.&nbsp; Many a
farmer had a sight of their comely, milk-white kine; many a swain had his
soul turned to romance and poesy by a sudden vision of themselves in the
guise of damsels arrayed in green, and radiant in beauty and grace; and
many a sportsman had his path crossed by <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>their white hounds of
supernatural fleetness and comeliness, the <i>Cwn Annwn</i>; but never had
any one been favoured with more than a passing view of either, till an old
farmer residing at Dyssyrnant, in the adjoining valley of Dyffryn Gwyn,
became at last the lucky captor of one of their milk-white kine.&nbsp; The
acquaintance which the <i>Gwartheg y Llyn</i>, the kine of the lake, had
formed with the farmer&rsquo;s cattle, like the loves of the angels for the
daughters of men, became the means of capture; and the farmer was thereby
enabled to add the mystic cow to his own herd, an event in all cases
believed to be most conducive to the worldly prosperity of him who should
make so fortunate an acquisition.&nbsp; Never was there such a cow, never
were there such calves, never such milk and butter, or cheese; and the fame
of the <i>Fuwch Gyfeiliorn</i>, the stray cow, was soon spread abroad
through that central part of Wales known as the district of Rhwng y ddwy
Afon, from the banks of the Mawddach to those of the Dofwy
(Dovey)&mdash;from Aberdiswnwy to Abercorris.&nbsp; The farmer, from a
small beginning, rapidly became, like Job, a man of substance, possessed of
thriving herds of cattle&mdash;a very patriarch among the mountains.&nbsp;
But, alas! wanting Job&rsquo;s restraining grace, his wealth made him
proud, his pride made him forget his obligation to the elfin cow, and
fearing she might soon become too old to be profitable, he fattened her for
the butcher, and then even she did not fail to distinguish herself, for a
more monstrously fat beast was never seen.&nbsp; At last the day of
slaughter came&mdash;an eventful day in the annals of a mountain
farm&mdash;the killing of a fat cow, and such a monster of obesity.&nbsp;
No wonder all the neighbours were gathered together to see the sight.&nbsp;
The old farmer looked upon the preparations in self-pleased importance; the
butcher felt he was about no common feat of his craft, <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>and, baring his arm,
he struck the blow&mdash;not now fatal, for before even a hair had been
injured, his arm was paralysed, the knife dropped from his hand, and the
whole company was electrified by a piercing cry that awakened an echo in a
dozen hills, and made the welkin ring again; and lo and behold! the whole
assemblage saw a female figure, clad in green, with uplifted arms, standing
on one of the rocks overhanging Llyn Barfog, and heard her calling with a
voice loud as thunder:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Dere di velen Einion,<br />
Cyrn cyveiliorn&mdash;braith y Llyn,<br />
A&rsquo;r voel Dodin,<br />
Codwch, dewch adre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come thou Einion&rsquo;s yellow one,<br />
Stray horns&mdash;speckled one of the Lake,<br />
And the hornless Dodin,<br />
Arise, come home.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And no sooner were these words of power uttered, than the original lake
cow, and all her progeny to the third and fourth generations, were in full
flight towards the heights of Llyn Barfog, as if pursued by the evil
one.&nbsp; Self-interest quickly roused the farmer, who followed in
pursuit, till, breathless and panting, he gained an eminence overlooking
the lake, but with no better success than to behold the green-attired dame
leisurely descending mid-lake, accompanied by the fugitive cows, and her
calves formed in a circle around her; they tossed their tails, she waved
her hands in scorn, as much as to say, &lsquo;You may catch us, my friend,
if you can,&rsquo; as they disappeared beneath the dark waters of the lake,
leaving only the yellow water-lily to mark the spot where they vanished,
and to perpetuate the memory of this strange event.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the
farmer looked with rueful countenance upon the spot where the elfin herd
disappeared, and had ample leisure to deplore <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>the effects of his
greediness, as with them also departed the prosperity which had hitherto
attended him, and he became impoverished to a degree below his original
circumstances, and in his altered circumstances few felt pity for one who,
in the noontide flow of prosperity, had shown himself so far forgetful of
favours received, as to purpose slaying his benefactor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
ends Dr. Pugh&rsquo;s account of the Stray Cow.</p>
<p>A tale very much like the preceding is recorded of a Scotch
farmer.&nbsp; It is to be found in vol. ii., pp. 45-6, of Croker&rsquo;s
<i>Fairy Legends of Ireland</i>, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A farmer who lived near a river had a cow which regularly every
year, on a certain day in May, left the meadow and went slowly along the
banks of the river till she came opposite to a small island overgrown with
bushes; she went into the water and waded or swam towards the island, where
she passed some time, and then returned to her pasture.&nbsp; This
continued for several years; and every year, at the usual season, she
produced a calf which perfectly resembled the elf bull.&nbsp; One
afternoon, about Martinmas, the farmer, when all the corn was got in and
measured, was sitting at his fireside, and the subject of the conversation
was, which of the cattle should be killed for Christmas.&nbsp; He said:
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have the cow; she is well fed, and has rendered good
services in ploughing, and filled the stalls with fine oxen, now we will
pick her old bones.&rsquo;&nbsp; Scarcely had he uttered these words when
the cow with her young ones rushed through the walls as if they had been
made of paper, went round the dunghill, bellowed at each of her calves, and
then drove them all before her, according to their age, towards the river,
where they got into the water, reached the island, and vanished among the
bushes.&nbsp; They were never more heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span><i>Ceffyl y Dwfr</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Water Horse</i>.</h4>
<p>The superstition respecting the water-horse, in one form or other, is
common to the Celtic race.&nbsp; He was supposed to intimate by
preternatural lights and noises the death of those about to perish by
water, and it was vulgarly believed that he even assisted in drowning his
victims.&nbsp; The water-horse was thought to be an evil spirit, who,
assuming the shape of a horse, tried to allure the unwary to mount him, and
then soaring into the clouds, or rushing over mountain, and water, would
suddenly vanish into air or mist, and precipitate his rider to
destruction.</p>
<p>The Welsh water-horse resembles the Kelpie of the Scotch.&nbsp;
Jamieson, under the word <i>Kelpie</i>, in his <i>Scottish Dictionary</i>,
quoting from various authors, as is his custom, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is described as an aquatic demon, who drowns not only men
but ships.&nbsp; The ancient Northern nations believed that he had the form
of a horse; and the same opinion is still held by the vulgar in
Iceland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loccenius informs us that in Sweden the vulgar are still afraid
of his power, and that swimmers are on their guard against his attacks;
being persuaded that he suffocates and carries off those whom he catches
under water.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; adds this writer,
&ldquo;it would seem that ferry-men warn those who are crossing dangerous
places in some rivers not so much as to mention his name; lest, as they
say, they should meet with a storm and be in danger of losing their
lives.&nbsp; Hence, doubtless, has this superstition originated; that, in
these places formerly, during the time of paganism, those who worshipped
their sea-deity <i>Nekr</i>, did so, as it were with a sacred silence, for
the reason already given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotch Kelpie closely resembled the Irish Phoocah, or Poocah, a
mischievous being, who was particularly dreaded on the night of All Hallow
E&rsquo;en, when it was <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>thought he had especial power; he delighted to
assume the form of a black horse, and should any luckless wight bestride
the fiendish steed, he was carried through brake and mire, over water and
land at a bewildering pace.&nbsp; Woe-betide the timid rider, for the
Poocah made short work of such an one, and soon made him kiss the
ground.&nbsp; But to the bold fearless rider the Poocah submitted
willingly, and became his obedient beast of burden.</p>
<p>The following quotation from the <i>Tales of the Cymry</i>, p. 151,
which is itself an extract from Mrs. S. C. Hall&rsquo;s <i>Ireland</i>,
graphically describes the Irish water fiend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The great object of the Poocah seems to be to obtain a rider, and
then he is in all his most malignant glory.&nbsp; Headlong he dashes
through briar and brake, through flood and fall, over mountain, valley,
moor, and river indiscriminately; up and down precipice is alike to him,
provided he gratifies the malevolence that seems to inspire him.&nbsp; He
bounds and flies over and beyond them, gratified by the distress, and
utterly reckless and ruthless of the cries, and danger, and suffering of
the luckless wight who bestrides him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the Poocah assumed the form of a goat, an eagle, or of some
other animal, and leaped upon the shoulders of the unwary traveller, and
clung to him, however frantic were the exertions to get rid of the
monster.</p>
<p>Allied to the water-horse were the horses upon which magicians in
various lands were supposed to perform their aerial journeys.</p>
<p>It was believed in Wales that the clergy could, without danger, ride the
water-horse, and the writer has heard a tale of a clergyman, who, when
bestride one of these horses, had compassion on his parish clerk, who was
trudging by his side, and permitted him to mount behind him, on <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>condition
that he should keep silence when upon the horse&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; For
awhile the loquacious parish clerk said no word, but ere long the wondrous
pace of the horse caused him to utter a pious ejaculation, and no sooner
were the words uttered than he was thrown to the ground; his master kept
his seat, and, on parting with the fallen parish official, shouted out,
&ldquo;Serve you right, why did you not keep your noisy tongue
quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weird legends and gloomy creations of the Celt assume a mild and
frolicsome feature when interpreted by the Saxon mind.&nbsp; The malevolent
Poocah becomes in England the fun-loving Puck, who delights in playing his
pranks on village maidens, and who says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am that merry wanderer of the night;<br />
Jest to Oberon, and make him smile,<br />
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br />
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;<br />
And sometimes lurk I in a gossip&rsquo;s bowl,<br />
In very likeness of a roasted crab;<br />
And when she drinks against her lips I bob,<br />
And on her withered dew-lap pour the ale.</p>
<p><i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Act I, Sc. I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Ceffyl-y-Dwfr</i> was very different to Chaucer&rsquo;s wonderful
brass horse, which could be ridden, without harm, by a sleeping
rider:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This steed of brasse, and easilie and well<br />
Can in the space of a day natur&eacute;l,<br />
This is to say, in foure and twenty houres,<br />
Where so ye lists, in drought or ell&eacute;s showers,<br />
Baren yours bodie into everie place,<br />
In which your heart&eacute; willeth for to pace,<br />
Withouten wemme of you through foul or fair,<br />
Or if you liste to flee as high in th&rsquo; aire<br />
As doth an eagle when him liste to soare,<br />
This same steed shall bear you evermore,<br />
Withouten harm, till ye be there you leste,<br />
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Though that ye sleepen on his back or reste;<br />
And turn againe with writhing of a pinne,<br />
He that it wroughte he could&eacute; many a gin,<br />
He waited many a constellation,<br />
Ere he had done this operation.</p>
<p><i>Chaucer&rsquo;s Squire&rsquo;s Tale</i>, 137-152.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rider of the magic horse was made acquainted with the charm that
secured its obedience, for otherwise he took an aerial ride at his
peril.&nbsp; This kind of invention is oriental, but it is sufficiently
like the Celtic in outline to indicate that all figments of the kind had
undoubtedly a common origin.</p>
<p>I have seen it somewhere stated, but where I cannot recall to mind,
that, the Water Horses did, in olden times, sport, on the Welsh mountains,
with the puny native ponies, before they became a mixed breed.</p>
<p>It was believed that the initiated could conjure up the River Horse by
shaking a magic bridle over the pool wherein it dwelt.</p>
<p>There is much curious information respecting this mythic animal in the
<i>Tales of the Cymry</i> and from this work I have culled many
thoughts.</p>
<h4><i>The Torrent Spectre</i>.</h4>
<p>This spectre was supposed to be an old man, or malignant spirit, who
directed, and ruled over, the mountain torrents.&nbsp; He delighted in
devastating the lands.&nbsp; His appearance was horrible to behold, and it
was believed that in the midst of the rushing stream his terrible form
could be discerned apparently moving with the torrent, but in reality
remaining stationary.&nbsp; Now he would raise himself half out of the
water, and ascend like a mist half as high as the near mountain, and then
he would dwindle down to the size of a man.&nbsp; His laugh accorded with
his savage visage, and his long hair stood on end, and a mist always
surrounded him.</p>
<p>Davies, in his <i>Mythology of the Druids</i>, says that believers in
this strange superstition are yet to be met with in <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Glamorganshire.&nbsp;
Davies was born in the parish of Llanvareth, Radnorshire, in 1756, and died
January 1st, 1831.</p>
<h4><i>Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>, <i>or Hag of the Mist</i>.</h4>
<p>Another supernatural being associated with water was the <i>Gwrach y
Rhibyn</i>.&nbsp; She was supposed to reside in the dripping fog, but was
seldom, if ever seen.&nbsp; It was believed that her shriek foretold
misfortune, if not death, to the hearer, and some even thought that, in a
shrill tenor, and lengthened voice, she called the person shortly to die by
name.</p>
<p><i>Yr Hen Chrwchwd</i>, or The Old Humpbacked, a fiend in the shape of
an old woman, is thought to be identical with this <i>Gwrach y
Rhibyn</i>.</p>
<p>In Carmarthenshire the spirit of the mist is represented, not as a
shrivelled up old woman, but as a hoary headed old man, who seats himself
on the hill sides, just where the clouds appear to touch them, and he is
called <i>Y Brenhin Llwyd</i>, or The Grey King.&nbsp; I know not what
functions this venerable personage, or king of the mist, performed, unless
it were, that he directed the mist&rsquo;s journey through the air.</p>
<h4><i>Mermaids and Mermen</i>.</h4>
<p>It is said that these fabulous beings frequented the sea-coasts of Wales
to the great danger of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The description of the Welsh
mermaid was just as it is all over the world; she is depicted as being
above the waist a most lovely young woman, whilst below she is like a fish
with fins and spreading tail.&nbsp; Both mermen and mermaids were fond, it
is said, of combing their long hair, and the siren-like song of the latter
was thought to be so seductive as to entice men to destruction.&nbsp; It
was believed that beautiful mermaids fell in love with comely young men and
even induced them to enter their abodes in the depth of the sea.</p>
<p>I heard the following tale, I believe in Carnarvonshire, but I have no
notes of it, and write from memory.</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>A man captured a mermaid, and took her home to his house, but she
did nothing but beg and beg to be allowed to return to the sea, but
notwithstanding her entreaties her captor kept her safe enough in a room,
and fastened the door so that she could not escape.&nbsp; She lingered
several days, pitifully beseeching the man to release her, and then she
died.&nbsp; But ever after that event a curse seemed to rest upon the man,
for he went from bad to worse, and died miserably poor.</p>
<p>It was always considered most unlucky to do anything unkind to these
beings.&nbsp; Fear acted as a powerful incentive, in days of old, to
generous conduct.&nbsp; For it was formerly believed that vengeance ever
overtook the cruel.</p>
<p>An Isle of Man legend, related by Waldron, in his account of the Isle of
Man, and reproduced by Croker, vol. i., p. 56, states, that some persons
captured a mermaid, and carried her to a house and treated her tenderly,
but she refused meat and drink, neither would she speak, when addressed,
though they knew these creatures could speak.&nbsp; Seeing that she began
to look ill, and fearing some great calamity would befall the island if she
died, they opened the door, after three days, and she glided swiftly to the
sea side.&nbsp; Her keeper followed at a distance and saw her plunge into
the sea, where she was met by a great number of her own species, one of
whom asked her what she had seen among those on land, to which she
answered, &ldquo;Nothing, but that they are so ignorant as to throw away
the very water they boil their eggs in.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>STORIES OF SATAN, GHOSTS, ETC.</h2>
<p>Although Max M&uuml;ller, in <i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>, vol.
ii., p. 238, states that &ldquo;The Aryan nations had no Devil,&rdquo; this
certainly cannot at present be affirmed of that <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>branch of the Celtic
race which inhabits Wales.&nbsp; In the Principality the Devil occupies a
prominent position in the foreground of Welsh Folk-Lore.&nbsp; He is,
however, generally depicted as inferior in cunning and intellect to a
bright-witted Welshman, and when worsted in a contest he acknowledges his
inferiority by disappearing in a ball or wheel of fire.&nbsp; Men, it was
supposed, could sell themselves to the Evil One for a term of years, but
they easily managed to elude the fulfilment of the contract, for there was
usually a loop-hole by which they escaped from the clutches of the stupid
Devil.&nbsp; For instance, a man disposes of his soul for riches,
pleasures, and supernatural knowledge and power, which he is to enjoy for a
long number of years, and in the contract it is stipulated that the
agreement holds good if the man is buried either <i>in</i> or
<i>outside</i> the church.&nbsp; To all appearance the victim is
irretrievably lost, but no, after enjoying all the fruits of his contract,
he cheats the Devil of his due, by being buried <i>in</i> or <i>under</i>
the church walls.</p>
<p>In many tales Satan is made to act a part detrimental to his own
interests; thus Sabbath breakers, card players, and those who practised
divination, have been frightened almost to death by the appearance of the
Devil, and there and then, being terrified by the horrible aspect of the
enemy, they commenced a new life.&nbsp; This thought comes out strongly in
<i>Y Bardd Cwsg</i>.&nbsp; The poet introduces one of the fallen angels as
appearing to act the part given to the Devil, in the play of Faust, when it
was being performed at Shrewsbury, and this appearance drove the
frequenters of the theatre from their pleasures to their prayers.&nbsp; His
words are:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dyma walch, ail i hwnw yn y Mwythig, y dydd arall, ar ganol
interlud Doctor Ffaustus; a rhai . . . pan oeddynt brysuraf, ymddangosodd y
diawl ei hun i chwareu ei bart ac wrth hynny gyrodd bawb o&rsquo;i bleser
i&rsquo;w weddiau.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>In English this is:&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a fine fellow,
second to that at Shrewsbury, who the other day, when the interlude of
Doctor Faustus was being acted, in the middle of the play, all being busily
engaged, the devil himself appeared to take his own part, and by so doing,
drove everyone from pleasure to prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The absurd conduct of the Evil Spirit on this occasion is held up to
ridicule by the poet, but the idea, which is an old one, that demons were,
by a superior power, obliged to frustrate their own designs, does not seem
to have been taken into consideration by him.&nbsp; He depicts the Devil as
a strange mixture of stupidity and remorseless animosity.&nbsp; But this,
undoubtedly, was the then general opinion.&nbsp; The bard revels in
harrowing descriptions of the tortures of the damned in Gehenna&mdash;the
abode of the Arch-fiend and his angels.&nbsp; This portion of his work was
in part the offspring of his own fervid imagination; but in part it might
have been suggested to him by what had been written already on the subject;
and from the people amongst whom he lived he could have, and did derive,
materials for these descriptions.&nbsp; In any case he did not outrage, by
any of his horrible depictions of Pandemonium, the sentiments of his fellow
countrymen, and his delineation of Satan was in full accord with the
popular opinion of his days.&nbsp; The bard did not create but gave
utterance to the fleeting thoughts which then prevailed respecting the
Devil.&nbsp; Indeed there does not seem to be in Wales any distinct
attributes ascribed to Satan, which are not also believed to be his
specialities in other countries.&nbsp; His personal appearance is the same
in most places.&nbsp; He is described as being black, with horns, and hoofs
and tail, he breathes fire and brimstone, and he is accompanied with the
clank of chains.&nbsp; Such was the uncouth form which Satan was supposed
to <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>assume, and such was the picture drawn of him formerly in
Wales.</p>
<p>There is a strong family likeness in this description between Satan and
<i>Pan</i>, who belongs to Greek and Egyptian mythology.&nbsp; Pan had two
small horns on his head, his nose was flat, and his legs, thighs, tail, and
feet were those of a goat.&nbsp; His face is described as ruddy, and he is
said to have possessed many qualities which are also ascribed to
Satan.&nbsp; His votaries were not encumbered with an exalted code of
morality.</p>
<p>The <i>Fauni</i>, certain deities of Italy, are also represented as
having the legs, feet, and ears of goats, and the rest of the body human,
and the <i>Satyri</i> of the Greeks are also described as having the feet
and legs of goats, with short horns on the head, and the whole body covered
with thick hair.&nbsp; These demigods revelled in riot and
lasciviousness.&nbsp; The satyrs attended upon Bacchus, and made themselves
conspicuous in his orgies.&nbsp; The Romans called their satyrs Fauni,
Panes, and Sylvani.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ascertain whether the Celt of Britain obtained
through the Romans their gross notions of the material body of Satan, or
whether it was in later times that they became possessed of this
idea.&nbsp; It may well have been that the Fauni, and other disreputable
deities of the conquerors of the world, on the introduction of Christianity
were looked upon as demons, and their forms consequently became fit
representations of the Spirit of Evil, from whom they differed little, if
any, in general attributes.&nbsp; In this way god after god would be
removed from their pedestals in the world&rsquo;s pantheon, and would be
relegated to the regions occupied by the great enemy of all that is pure,
noble, and good in mankind.&nbsp; Thus the god of one age would become the
devil of the succeeding age, retaining, nevertheless, <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>by a cruel irony, the
same form and qualities in his changed position that he had in his exalted
state.</p>
<p>It is by some such reasoning as the preceding that we can account for
the striking personal resemblance between the Satan of medi&aelig;val and
later times and the mythical deities already mentioned.</p>
<p>Reference has been made to the rustic belief that from his mouth Satan
emits fire and brimstone, and here again we observe traces of classic
lore.&nbsp; The fabulous monsters, Typh&aelig;us, or Typhon, and
Chim&aelig;ra, are probably in this matter his prototypes.&nbsp; It is said
that real flames of devouring fire darted from the mouth and eyes of
Typhon, and that he uttered horrible yells, like the shrieks of different
animals, and Chim&aelig;ra is described as continually vomiting flames.</p>
<p>Just as the gods of old could assume different shapes, so could
Satan.&nbsp; The tales which follow show that he could change himself at
will into the form of a lovely woman, a mouse, a pig, a black dog, a cock,
a fish, a headless horse, and into other animals or monstrous beings.&nbsp;
But the form which, it is said, he usually assumed to enable him to escape
when discovered in his intrigues was a ball or hoop of fire.</p>
<p>The first series of tales which I shall relate depict Satan as taking a
part in the pastimes of the people.</p>
<h3>Satan Playing Cards.</h3>
<p>A good many years ago I travelled from Pentrevoelas to Yspytty in
company with Mr. Lloyd, the then vicar of the latter parish, who, when
crossing over a bridge that spanned a foaming mountain torrent, called my
attention to the spot, and related to me the following tale connected with
the place:&mdash;</p>
<p>A man was returning home late one night from a <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>friend&rsquo;s house,
where he had spent the evening in card playing, and as he was walking along
he was joined by a gentleman, whose conversation was very
interesting.&nbsp; At last they commenced talking about card playing, and
the stranger invited the countryman to try his skill with him, but as it
was late, and the man wanted to go home, he declined, but when they were on
the bridge his companion again pressed him to have a game on the parapet,
and proceeded to take out of his pocket a pack of cards, and at once
commenced dealing them out; consequently, the man could not now refuse to
comply with the request.&nbsp; With varying success game after game was
played, but ultimately the stranger proved himself the more skilful
player.&nbsp; Just at this juncture a card fell into the water; and in
their excitement both players looked over the bridge after it, and the
countryman saw to his horror that his opponent&rsquo;s head, reflected in
the water, had on it <i>two horns</i>.&nbsp; He immediately turned round to
have a careful look at his companion; he, however, did not see him, but in
his place was a <i>ball of fire</i>, which flashed away from his sight.</p>
<p>I must say that when I looked over the bridge I came to the conclusion
that nothing could have been reflected in the water, for it was a rushing
foaming torrent, with no single placid spot upon its surface.</p>
<p>Another version of the preceding tale I obtained from the Rev. Owen
Jones.&nbsp; In this instance the <i>cloven foot</i> and not the <i>horned
head</i> was detected.&nbsp; The scene of this tale is laid in the parish
of Rhuddlan near Rhyl.</p>
<h3>Satan Playing Cards at a Merry Meeting.</h3>
<p>It was formerly a general custom in Wales for young lads and lasses to
meet and spend a pleasant evening together in various farmhouses.&nbsp;
Many kinds of amusements, such as dancing, singing, and card playing, were
resorted to, <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>to while away the time.&nbsp; The Rev. Owen Jones informed me
that once upon a time a merry party met at H&ecirc;nafon near Rhuddlan, and
when the fun was at its height a gentleman came to the farm, and joined
heartily in all the merriment.&nbsp; By and by, card playing was
introduced, and the stranger played better than any present.&nbsp; At last
a card fell to the ground, and the party who picked it up discovered that
the clever player had a cloven foot.&nbsp; In his fright the man screamed
out, and immediately the Evil One&mdash;for he it was that had joined the
party&mdash;transformed himself into a wheel of fire, and disappeared up
the chimney.</p>
<p>For the next tale I am also indebted to my friend the Rev. Owen
Jones.&nbsp; The story appears in a Welsh MS. in his possession, which he
kindly lent me.&nbsp; I will, first of all, give the tale in the
vernacular, and then I will, for the benefit of my English readers, supply
an English translation.</p>
<h3>Satan Playing Cards on Rhyd-y-Cae Bridge,
Pentrevoelas.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Gwas yn y Gilar a phen campwr ei oes am chwareu cardiau oedd
Robert Llwyd Hari.&nbsp; Ond wrth fyn&rsquo;d adre&rsquo; o Rhydlydan, wedi

name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>a Phlas Iolyn, ac
aeth yntau adre&rsquo; i&rsquo;r Gilar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The English of the
tale is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Robert Llwyd Hari was a servant in Gilar farm, and the champion card
player of his day.&nbsp; When going home from Rhydlydan, after a game of
cards in Aunty Ann&rsquo;s house, called the Green, he was met at the end
of the cross-lane by a gentleman, who entered into conversation with
him.&nbsp; The gentleman asked him to have a game of cards.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have no cards,&rdquo; answered Bob.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes you have, you have two
packs in your pocket,&rdquo; answered the gentleman.&nbsp; They settled to
play a game on the bridge of Rhyd-y-Cae, as it was a beautiful moonlight
night.&nbsp; The gentleman was very pressing that they should go to Plas
Iolyn, because they would find there, he said, plenty of light, although no
one was then living at the place.&nbsp; But Bob positively refused to go
there.&nbsp; They commenced the game in downright good earnest on the
bridge, R. Ll. winning every game.&nbsp; But a card fell over the bridge
into the water, and Bob looked over, and saw that the gentleman had hoofs
like a horse.&nbsp; He swore by the Great Being that he would not play any
longer, and on this his partner turned himself into a <i>wheel of fire</i>,
and departed bowling towards Plas Iolyn, and Bob went home to Gilar.</p>
<h3>Satan Snatching a Man up into the Air.</h3>
<p>It would appear that poor Bob was doomed to a sad end.&nbsp; His last
exploit is thus given:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrth fyned adre o chware cardia, ar Bont Maesgwyn gwelai Robert
Llwyd Hari gylch crwn o d&acirc;n; bu agos iddo droi yn ol, cymerodd galon
eilwaith gan gofio fod ganddo Feibl yn ei boced, ac i ffordd ag e rhyngddo
a&rsquo;r t&acirc;n, a phan oedd yn passio fe&rsquo;i cipiwyd i fyny

gollyngodd ef i lawr nes ydoedd yn disgyn yn farw mewn llyn a elwir Llyn
Hari.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Which in English is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>When going home from playing cards, on Maesgwyn Bridge Robert Llwyd Hari
saw a hoop of fire; he was half inclined to turn back, but took heart,
remembering that he had a Bible in his pocket.&nbsp; So on he went, and
when passing the fire he was snatched up into the air by the Bad Man, but
he was able to utter a certain word to the D---, he was dropped down, and
fell dead into a lake called Harry&rsquo;s Lake.</p>
<p>Many tales, varying slightly from the preceding three stories, are still
extant in Wales, but these given are so typical of all the rest that it is
unnecessary to record more.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that card playing was looked upon in the last
century&mdash;and the feeling has not by any means disappeared in our
days&mdash;as a deadly sin, and consequently a work pleasing to the Evil
One, but it appears singular that the aid of Satan himself should have been
invoked to put down a practice calculated to further his own
interests.&nbsp; The incongruity of such a proceeding did not apparently
enter into the minds of those who gave currency to these unequal
contests.&nbsp; But in the tales we detect the existence of a tradition
that Satan formerly joined in the pastimes of the people, and, if for card
playing some other game were substituted, such as dancing, we should have a
reproduction of those fabulous times, when satyrs and demigods and other
prototypes of Satan are said to have been upon familiar terms with mortals,
and joined in their sports.</p>
<p>The reader will have noticed that the poor man who lost his life in the
Lake thought himself safe because he had a Bible in his pocket.&nbsp; This
shows that the Bible was looked upon as a talisman.&nbsp; But in this
instance its efficacy was only partial.&nbsp; I shall have more to say on
this subject in another part of this work.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Satan in the preceding tales, and others, which shall by and by
be related, is represented as transforming himself into a ball, or wheel of
fire&mdash;into fire, the emblem of an old religion, a religion which has
its votaries in certain parts of the world even in this century, and which,
at one period in the history of the human race, was widespread.&nbsp; It is
very suggestive that Satan should be spoken of as assuming the form of the
Fire God, when his personality is detected, and the hint, conveyed by this
transformation, would imply that he was himself the Fire God.</p>
<p>Having made these few comments on the preceding tales, I will now record
a few stories in which Satan is made to take a role similar to that
ascribed to him in the card-playing stories.</p>
<p>In the following tales Satan&rsquo;s aid is invoked to bring about a
reformation in the observance of the Sabbath day.</p>
<h3>Satan frightening a Man for gathering Nuts on Sunday.</h3>
<p>The following tale was related to me by the Rev. W. E. Jones, rector of
Bylchau, near Denbigh:&mdash;</p>
<p>Richard Roberts, Coederaill, Bylchau, when a young man, worked in
Flintshire, and instead of going to a place of worship on Sunday he got
into the habit of wandering about the fields on that day.&nbsp; One fine
autumn Sunday he determined to go a-nutting.&nbsp; He came to a wood where
nuts were plentiful, and in a short time he filled his pockets with nuts,
but perceiving a bush loaded with nuts, he put out his hand to draw the
branch to him, when he observed a hairy hand stretching towards the same
branch.&nbsp; As soon as he saw this hand he was terribly frightened, and
without turning round to see anything further of it, he took to his heels,
and never afterwards did he venture to go a-nutting on Sunday.</p>
<p>Richard Roberts told the tale to Mr. Jones, his Rector, <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>who tried to
convince Roberts that a monkey was in the bush, but he affirmed that Satan
had come to him.</p>
<h3>Satan taking possession of a man who fished on Sunday.</h3>
<p>The following tale is in its main features still current in Cynwyd, a
village about two miles from Corwen.&nbsp; The first reference to the story
that I am acquainted with appeared in an essay sent in to a local
Eisteddfod in 1863.&nbsp; The story is thus related in this
essay:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half a mile from Cynwyd is the &lsquo;Mill
Waterfall,&rsquo; beneath which there is a deep linn or whirlpool, where a
man, who was fishing there on Sunday, once found an enormous fish.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will catch him, though the D---l take me,&rsquo; said the
presumptuous man.&nbsp; The fish went under the fall, the man followed him,
and was never afterwards seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the tale, but it is, or
was believed, that Satan had changed himself into a fish, and by allurement
got the man into his power and carried him bodily to the nethermost
regions.</p>
<h3>Satan appearing in many forms to a Man who Travelled on
Sunday.</h3>
<p>I received the following tale from my deceased friend, the Rev. J. L.
Davies, late Rector of Llangynog, near Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, and he
obtained it from William Davies, the man who figures in the story.</p>
<p>As a preface to the tale, it should be stated that it was usual, some
years ago, for Welsh labourers to proceed to the harvest in England, which
was earlier there than in Wales, and after that was finished, they hastened
homewards to be in time for their own harvest.&nbsp; These migratory Welsh
harvestmen are not altogether extinct in our days, but about forty years
ago they were much more common than they are at present.&nbsp; Then
respectable farmers&rsquo; sons with sickles on their backs, and well
filled wallets over their <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>shoulders, went in companies to the early
English Lowlands to hire themselves as harvest labourers.&nbsp; My tale now
commences:&mdash;</p>
<p>William Davies, Penrhiw, near Aberystwyth, went to England for the
harvest, and after having worked there about three weeks, he returned home
alone, with all possible haste, as he knew that his father-in-law&rsquo;s
fields were by this time ripe for the sickle.&nbsp; He, however, failed to
accomplish the journey before Sunday; but he determined to travel on
Sunday, and thus reach home on Sunday night to be ready to commence reaping
on Monday morning.&nbsp; His conscience, though, would not allow him to be
at rest, but he endeavoured to silence its twittings by saying to himself
that he had with him no clothes to go to a place of worship.&nbsp; He
stealthily, therefore, walked on, feeling very guilty every step he took,
and dreading to meet anyone going to chapel or church.&nbsp; By Sunday
evening he had reached the hill overlooking Llanfihangel Creuddyn, where he
was known, so he determined not to enter the village until after the people
had gone to their respective places of worship; he therefore sat down on
the hill side and contemplated the scene below.&nbsp; He saw the people
leave their houses for the house of God, he heard their songs of praise,
and now he thinks he could venture to descend and pass through the village
unobserved.&nbsp; Luckily no one saw him going through the village, and now
he has entered a barley field, and although still uneasy in mind, he feels
somewhat reassured, and steps on quickly.&nbsp; He had not proceeded far in
the barley field before he found himself surrounded by a large number of
small pigs.&nbsp; He was not much struck by this, though he thought it
strange that so many pigs should be allowed to wander about on the Sabbath
day.&nbsp; The pigs, however, <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>came up to him, stared at him, grunted, and
scampered away.&nbsp; Before he had traversed the barley field he saw
approaching him an innumerable number of mice, and these, too, surrounded
him, only, however, to stare at him, and then to disappear.&nbsp; By this
Davies began to be frightened, and he was almost sorry that he had broken
the Sabbath day by travelling with his pack on his back instead of keeping
the day holy.&nbsp; He was not now very far from home, and this thought
gave him courage and on he went.&nbsp; He had not proceeded any great
distance from the spot where the mice had appeared when he saw a large
greyhound walking before him on the pathway.&nbsp; He anxiously watched the
dog, but suddenly it vanished out of his sight.&nbsp; By this the poor man
was thoroughly frightened, and many and truly sincere were his regrets that
he had broken the Sabbath; but on he went.&nbsp; He passed through the
village of Llanilar without any further fright.&nbsp; He had now gone about
three miles from Llanfihangel along the road that goes to Aberystwyth, and
he had begun to dispel the fear that had seized him, but to his horror he
saw something approach him that made his hair stand on end.&nbsp; He could
not at first make it out, but he soon clearly saw that it was a horse that
was madly dashing towards him.&nbsp; He had only just time to step on to
the ditch, when, horrible to relate, a headless white horse rushed past
him.&nbsp; His limbs shook and the perspiration stood out like beads on his
forehead.&nbsp; This terrible spectre he saw when close to Tan&rsquo;rallt,
but he dared not turn into the house, as he was travelling on Sunday, so on
he went again, and heartily did he wish himself at home.&nbsp; In fear and
dread he proceeded on his journey towards Penrhiw.&nbsp; The most direct
way from Tan&rsquo;rallt to Penrhiw was a pathway through the fields, and
Davies took this pathway, and now he was in sight of his home, and he <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>hastened towards the boundary fence between Tan&rsquo;rallt and
Penrhiw.&nbsp; He knew that there was a gap in the hedge that he could get
through, and for this gap he aimed; he reached it, but further progress was
impossible, for in the gap was a lady lying at full length, and immovable,
and stopping up the gap entirely.&nbsp; Poor Davies was now more thoroughly
terrified than ever.&nbsp; He sprang aside, he screamed, and then he
fainted right away.&nbsp; As soon as he recovered consciousness, he, on his
knees, and in a loud supplicating voice, prayed for pardon.&nbsp; His
mother and father-in-law heard him, and the mother knew the voice and said,
&ldquo;It is my Will; some mishap has overtaken him.&rdquo;&nbsp; They went
to him and found he was so weak that he could not move, and they were
obliged to carry him home, where he recounted to them his marvellous
experience.</p>
<p>My clerical friend, who was intimately acquainted with William Davies,
had many conversations with him about his Sunday journey, and he argued the
matter with him, and tried to persuade him that he had seen nothing, but
that it was his imagination working on a nervous temperament that had
created all his fantasies.&nbsp; He however failed to convince him, for
Davies affirmed that it was no hallucination, but that what he had seen
that Sunday was a punishment for his having broken the Fourth
Commandment.&nbsp; It need hardly be added that Davies ever afterwards was
a strict observer of the Day of Rest.</p>
<p>The following tale, taken from <i>A Relation of Apparitions</i>, etc.,
by the Rev. Edmund Jones, inculcates the same lesson as that taught by the
previous tales.&nbsp; I will give the tale a title.</p>
<h3>The Evil Spirit appearing to a Man who frequented Alehouses on
Sunday.</h3>
<p>Jones writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;W. J. was once a <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Sabbath-breaker at <i>Risca</i> village, where he frequently used
to play and visit the alehouses on the Sabbath day, and there stay till
late at night.&nbsp; On returning homeward he heard something walking
behind him, and turning to see what it was he could see the likeness of a
man walking by his side; he could not see his face, and was afraid to look
much at it, fearing it was an evil spirit, as it really was, therefore he
did not wish it good night.&nbsp; This dreadful dangerous apparition
generally walked by the left side of him.&nbsp; It afterwards appeared like
a great mastiff dog, which terrified him so much that he knew not where he
was.&nbsp; After it had gone about half a mile, it transformed itself into
a great fire, as large as a small field, and resembled the noise which a
fire makes in burning gorse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This vision seems to have had the desired effect on W. J. for we are
told that he <i>was once</i> a Sabbath breaker, the inference being, that
he was not one when the Rev. Edmund Jones wrote the above narrative.</p>
<p>Tales of this kind could be multiplied to almost any extent, but more
need not be given.&nbsp; The one idea that runs through them all is that
Satan has appeared, and may appear again, to Sabbath breakers, and
therefore those who wish to avoid coming in contact with him should keep
the Sabbath day holy.</p>
<h3>Satan Outwitted.</h3>
<p>In the preceding tales the Evil One is depicted as an agent in the
destruction of his own kingdom.&nbsp; He thus shows his obtuseness, or his
subordination to a higher power.&nbsp; In the story that follows, he is
outwitted by a Welshman.&nbsp; Many variants of this tale are found in many
countries.&nbsp; It is evident from this and like stories, that it was
believed the Spirit of Evil could easily be circumvented by an intelligent
human being.</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>The tale is taken from <i>Y Brython</i>, vol. v., p. 192.&nbsp; I
when a lad often heard the story related, and the scene is laid in
Trefeglwys, Montgomeryshire, a parish only a few miles distant from the
place where I spent my childhood.&nbsp; The writer in <i>Y Brython</i>,
speaking of <i>Ffinant</i>, says that this farm is about a mile from
Trefeglwys, on the north side of the road leading to Newtown.&nbsp; He then

<blockquote>
<p>Dafydd Hiraddug ei ryw,<br />
<i>Ffals</i> yn farw, <i>ffals</i> yn fyw.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tale in English is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>There is an incredible tradition connected with this place Ffinant,
Trefeglwys.&nbsp; It is said that an old barn stands on the right hand side
of the highway.&nbsp; One Sunday morning, as the master was starting to
church, he told one of the servants to keep the crows from a field that had
been sown with wheat, in which field the old barn stood.&nbsp; The servant,
through some means, collected all the crows into the barn, and shut the
door on them.&nbsp; He then followed his master to the Church, who, when he
saw the servant there, began to reprove him sharply.&nbsp; But the master,
when he heard the strange news, turned his steps homewards, and found to
his amazement that the tale was true, and it is said that the barn was
filled with crows.&nbsp; This barn, ever afterwards was called
<i>Crow-barn</i>, a name it still retains.</p>
<p>It is said that the servant&rsquo;s name was Dafydd Hiraddug, and that
he had sold himself to the devil, and that consequently, he was able to
perform feats, which in this age are considered incredible.&nbsp; However,
it is said that Dafydd was on this occasion more subtle than the old
serpent, even according to the agreement which was between them.&nbsp; The
contract was, that the devil was to have complete possession of Dafydd if
his corpse were taken over the side of the bed, or through a door, or if
buried in a churchyard, or inside a church.&nbsp; Dafydd had commanded,
that on his death, the liver and lights were to be taken out of his body
and thrown on the dunghill, and notice was to be taken whether a raven or a
dove got possession of them; if a raven, then his body was to be taken away
by the foot, and not by the side <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>of the bed, and
through the wall, and not through the door, and he was to be buried, not in
the churchyard nor in the Church, but under the Church walls.&nbsp; And the
devil, when he saw that by these arrangements he had been duped cried,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dafydd Hiraddug, badly bred,</p>
<p>False when living, and false when dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the tale.&nbsp; I now come to another series of Folk-Lore
stories, which seem to imply that in ancient days rival religions savagely
contended for the supremacy, and in these tales also Satan occupies a
prominent position.</p>
<h3>Satan and Churches.</h3>
<p>The traditional stories that are still extant respecting the determined
opposition to the erection of certain churches in particular spots, and the
removal of the materials during the night to some other site, where
ultimately the new edifice was obliged to be erected, and the many stories
of haunted churches, where evil spirits had made a lodgment, and could not
for ages be ousted, are evidences of the antagonism of rival forms of
paganism, or of the opposition of an ancient religion to the new and
intruding Christian Faith.</p>
<p>Brash in his <i>Ogam Inscribed Stones</i>, p. 109, speaking of Irish
Churches, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that many of our early churches were erected on
sites professedly pagan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most ancient churches in Wales have circular or ovoidal
churchyards&mdash;a form essentially Celtic&mdash;and it may well be that
these sacred spots were dedicated to religious purposes in pagan times, and
were appropriated by the early Christians,&mdash;not, perhaps, without
opposition on the part of the adherents of the old faith&mdash;and
consecrated to the use of the Christian religion.&nbsp; In these
churchyards were often to be found holy, or sacred wells, and many of them
<!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>still exist, and modes of divination were practised at these
wells, which have come down to our days, and which must have originated in
pre-Christian or pagan times.</p>
<p>It is highly probable that the older faith would for a while exist
concurrently with the new, and mutual contempt and annoyance on the part of
the supporters of the respective beliefs would as naturally follow in those
times as in any succeeding age, but this fact should be
emphasised&mdash;that the modes of warfare would correspond with the
civilized or uncivilized state of the opponents.&nbsp; This remark is
general in its application, and applies to races conquered by the Celts in
Britain, quite as much as to races who conquered the Celt, and there are
not wanting certain indications that the tales associated with Satan belong
to a period long anterior to the introduction of Christianity.&nbsp;
Certain classes of these tales undoubtedly refer to the antagonism of
beliefs more ancient than the Christian faith, and they indicate the
measures taken by one party to suppress the other.&nbsp; Thus we see it
related that the Evil Spirit is forcibly ejected from churches, and dragged
to the river, and there a tragedy occurs.&nbsp; In other words a horrible
murder is committed on the representative of the defeated religion.&nbsp;
The very fact that he loses his life in a river&mdash;in water&mdash;in an
object of wide spread worship&mdash;is not without its significance.</p>
<p>We have seen in the legend of the Evil Spirit in Cerrig-y-drudion
Church, p. 133,&mdash;that it was ejected, after a severe struggle, from
the sacred building&mdash;that it was dragged to the lake, where it lost
its life, by two <i>Ychain Banawg</i>&mdash;that they, and it, perished
together in the lake:&mdash;Now these <i>Ychain Banawg</i> or long-horned
oxen, huge in size and strong of limb, are traditional, if not fabulous
animals, and this one incident in the legend is enough to <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>prove its
great antiquity.&nbsp; Undoubtedly it dates from remote pre-Christian
times, and yet the tale is associated with modern ideas, and modes of
expression.&nbsp; It has come down to us along the tide of time, and has
received its colouring from the ages it has passed through.&nbsp; Yet on
the very surface of this ancient legend we perceive it written that in days
of old there was severe antagonism between rival forms of pagan faith, and
the manner in which the weaker&mdash;and perhaps the more ancient&mdash;is
overcome, is made clear.&nbsp; The instrument used is brute force, and the
vanquished party is <i>drowned</i> or, in the euphonious language of the
tales, <i>is laid</i>.</p>
<p>There are many stories of spirits that have been cast out of churches,
still extant in Wales, and one of the most famous of these is that of
Llanfor Church, near Bala.&nbsp; It resembles that of
Cerrig-y-drudion.&nbsp; I have succeeded in obtaining several versions of
this legend.&nbsp; I am indebted for the first to Mr. R. Roberts,
Clocaenog, a native of Bala.</p>
<h4><i>The Ejectment of the Evil Spirit from Llanfor Church</i>.</h4>
<p>Mr. Roberts states that his grandmother, born in 1744, had only
traditions of this spirit.&nbsp; He was said to have worn a three-cocked
hat, and appeared as a gentleman, and whilst divine service was performed
he stood up in the church.&nbsp; But at night the church was lit up by his
presence, and the staves between the railings of the gallery were set in
motion, by him, like so many spindles, although they were fast in their
sockets.&nbsp; He is not reported to have harmed any one, neither did he
commit any damage in the church.&nbsp; It is said, he had been seen taking
a walk to the top of <i>Moel-y-llan</i>, and although harmless he was a
great terror to the neighbourhood, and but few would venture to enter the
church alone.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts was told that on a certain occasion a
vestry was held in a public house, that stood on <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>the north side of the
church, not a vestige of which now remains, but no one would go to the
church for the parish books.&nbsp; The landlady had the courage to go but
no sooner had she crossed the threshold than the Evil Spirit blew the light
out; she got a light again, but this also was blown out.&nbsp; Instead of
returning for another light, she went straight to the coffer in the dark,
and brought the books to the house, and that without any molestation.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts states that as the Spirit of darkness became more and more
troublesome, it was determined to have him removed, and two gentlemen
skilled in divination were called <i>to offer him to
Llyn-y-Geulan-Goch</i>.&nbsp; These men were procured and they entered the
church in the afternoon and held a conversation with the Spirit, and in the
end told him that they would call at such an hour of the night to remove
him to his rest.&nbsp; But they were not punctual and when they entered
they found him intractable, however, he was compelled to submit, and was
driven out of the church in the form of a cock, and carried behind his
vanquisher on horseback, and thrown into <i>Llyn-y-Geulan-Goch</i>.</p>
<p>According to tradition the horse made the journey from the church to the
pool by two leaps.&nbsp; The distance was two fields&rsquo; breadth.</p>
<p>On their arrival at the river side, a terrible struggle ensued, the
Fiend would not submit to be imprisoned, and he made a most determined
attempt to drag his captors into the water.&nbsp; He, however, by and by,
agreed to enter his prison on the condition that they would lie on their
faces towards the ground when he entered the river, this they did, and the
Spirit with a splash jumped into the water.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts further states, that there was a tradition in those parts,
that the horse which carried the Devil to the river left the impression of
his hoof in a stone by the river side, <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>but Mr. Roberts
assures me that he could never discover this stone, nor did he know of any
one who had seen it.</p>
<p>The case of the imprisoned Spirit was not hopeless&mdash;tradition says
he was to remain in the pool only until he counted all the sand in
it.&nbsp; It would almost appear that he had accomplished his task, for Mr.
Roberts says that he had heard that his father&rsquo;s eldest brother
whilst driving his team in the dead of night through Llanfor village saw
two pigs walking behind the waggon.&nbsp; He thought nothing of this, and
began to apply his whip to them, but to no purpose, for they followed him
to <i>Llyn-y-Geulan-Goch</i>, and then disappeared.</p>
<p>There was in these latter times some dispute as to the Spirit being
still in the pool.&nbsp; This, however, has been settled in the
affirmative.&nbsp; A wise man, in company with others, proceeded to the
river, and threw a stone with writing on it into the pool, but nothing came
of it, and he then affirmed there was no spirit there.&nbsp; This the
people would not believe, so he threw another stone into the water, and now
the river boiled up and foamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the sceptic,
&ldquo;he is there, and there he will remain for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is Mr. Roberts&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p><i>Llyn-y-Geulan-Goch</i> is a pool in the river Dee, about a quarter of
a mile from Llanfor village.</p>
<p>For the purpose of shewing how variously tales are narrated, I will give
another version of this haunted church, which was taken down by me from the
mouth of an aged woman, a native of the village, whose life had been spent
among her own people, and who at present lives in a little cottage on the
road side between Llanfor Rectory and Bala.&nbsp; Her name is Ann Hughes,
she firmly believes the story, but she could not tell how long ago the
spirit was driven out of the church, though she thought it was in her
grandfather&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; Her tale was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>The Evil Spirit was heard but not seen by the people, and he was
in the habit of coming down the pathway leading from Rhiwlas to the church,
making a great noise, as if dragging after him chains, or wheeling a
wheelbarrow, and he went straight into the church, and there he stayed all
night lighting up the church and making a great noise, as though engaged in
manual labour.&nbsp; There was then a pathway leading to a row of houses
situated in the church yard on the north side, and the people who occupied
those cottages dared not leave them the live-long night, in fact the whole
village avoided that, and every other path in the neighbourhood of the
church, whilst the Spirit was in the church, and every one could see when
he was there.&nbsp; At last the disturbance was so great that the parson
and another man determined to lay the Spirit, and therefore one night they
walked three times round the church, and then went into it, and by and by
three men were seen emerging from the church and they walked into the
public house through the door that opened into the church yard and they
went together into the little parlour.&nbsp; The parson had already given
instructions that no one was to come to them on any account, nor even to
try to get a glimpse of them; but there was a man in the house who went to
the keyhole of the parlour and, looking into the room, saw distinctly three
men sitting round the table.&nbsp; No sooner, however, had he done so than
the parson came out and said if anyone looked through the keyhole again
their plans would be frustrated.&nbsp; This put a stop to all further
inquisitiveness, and their deliberations were not again interrupted.</p>
<p>Ann Hughes could not tell me what plan was adopted to get rid of the
Evil Spirit, but she knew this much, that he was laid in
<i>Llyn-y-Geulan-Goch</i>, and that he was to remain there until a lighted
candle, which was hidden somewhere <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>in the church, when
the Spirit was overcome, should go out.&nbsp; Often and again had she
searched for this taper, but failed to discover it, but she supposes it is
still burning somewhere, for the Evil One has not yet escaped from the
pool.</p>
<p>There is a version of the ejectment of Llanfor Spirit given in <i>Y
Gordofigion</i>, p. 106, which is somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Llanfor Spirit troubled the neighbourhood of Bala, but he was
particularly objectionable and annoying to the inhabitants of Llanfor, for
he had taken possession of their Church.&nbsp; At last, the people were
determined to get rid of him altogether, but they must procure a mare for
this purpose, which they did.&nbsp; A man riding on the mare entered the
Church with a friend, to exorcise the Spirit.&nbsp; Ere long this man
emerged from the Church with the Devil seated behind him on the
pillion.&nbsp; An old woman who saw them cried out, &ldquo;Duw anwyl!&nbsp;
Mochyn yn yr Eglwys&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Good God!&nbsp; A pig in the
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; On hearing these words the pig became exceedingly
fierce, because the silence had been broken, and because God&rsquo;s name
had been used, and in his anger he snatched up both the man and the mare,
and threw them right over the Church to the other side, and there is a mark
to this day on a grave stone of the horse&rsquo;s hoof on the spot where
she lit.&nbsp; But the Spirit&rsquo;s anger was all in vain, for he was
carried by the mare to the river, and laid in <i>Llyn-y-Geulan-Goch</i>,
but so much did the poor animal perspire whilst carrying him, that,
although the distance was only a quarter of a mile, she lost all her
hair.</p>
<p>Tales very much like the preceding are related of many churches in
Wales.&nbsp; The details differ, but in general outlines they are
alike.&nbsp; I will give one other story of this kind.</p>
<h4><i>An Evil Spirit in Llandysilio Church, Montgomeryshire</i>.</h4>
<p>The history of this Spirit&rsquo;s proceedings is given in <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span><i>Bye-Gones</i>, Vol. ii, p. 179, and the writer&rsquo;s
fictitious name is <i>Gypt</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This church,&rdquo; says <i>Gypt</i>, &ldquo;was terribly
troubled by a Spirit in times gone by, so I was informed by a person who
took me over the church, and, being curious to hear the story, my guide
related the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To such extremes had things come that it was resolved to send for
a well known and expert person to lay the Spirit.&nbsp; But the Spirit
nearly overcame the expert, and the fight continued hard and fast for a
long time.&nbsp; The ghost layer came out often for fresh air and beer, and
then was plainly seen, from his bared arms and the perspiration running
down his face, that there was a terrible conflict going on within the
church.&nbsp; At last success crowned the effort, and the Spirit, not
unlike a large fly, was put into a bottle and thrown into a deep pool in
the River Verniew, where it remains to this day, and the church was
troubled no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Gypt</i> adds:&mdash;&ldquo;As a proof of the truth of the story, my
informant showed me the beams which were cracked at the time the Spirit
troubled the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these tales we have a few facts common to them all.&nbsp; An Evil
Spirit troubles the people, and makes his home nightly in the church, which
he illuminates.&nbsp; His presence there becomes obnoxious, and ultimately,
either by force or trickery, he is ejected, and loses his life, or at least
he is deposited by his captors in a lake, or pool of water, and then peace
and quietness ensue.</p>
<p>There is a good deal that is human about these stories when stripped of
the marvellous, which surrounds them, and it is not unreasonable to ask
whether they had, or had not, a foundation in fact, or whether they were
solely the creations of an imaginative people.&nbsp; It is not, at least,
improbable that these ghostly stories had, in long distant <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>pre-historic
times, their origin in fact, and that they have reached our days with
glosses received from the intervening ages.</p>
<p>They seem to imply that, in ancient times, there was deadly antagonism
between one form of Pagan worship and another, and, although it is but
dimly hinted, it would appear that fire was the emblem or the god of one
party, and water the god of the other; and that the water worshippers
prevailed and destroyed the image, or <i>laid</i> the priest, of the
vanquished deity in a pool, and took possession of his sacred
enclosures.</p>
<p>It was commonly believed, within the last hundred years or so, that Evil
Spirits at certain times of the year, such as St. John&rsquo;s Eve, and May
Day Eve, and All Hallows&rsquo; Eve, were let loose, and that on these
nights they held high revelry in churches.&nbsp; This is but another and
more modern phase of the preceding stories.&nbsp; This superstitious belief
was common to Scotland, and everyone who has read Burns has heard of
Alloway Kirk, and of the &ldquo;unco sight&rdquo; which met <i>Tam o&rsquo;
Shanter&rsquo;s</i> eye there, who, looking into the haunted kirk, saw
witches, Evil Spirits, and Old Nick himself.&nbsp; Thus sings the
poet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There sat auld Nick, in shape o&rsquo; beast;<br />
A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large,<br />
To gi&rsquo;e them music was his charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in Wales it was believed that a Spirit&mdash;an evil
one&mdash;certainly not an Angel of Light, revealed, to the inquisitive,
coming events, provided they went to the church porch on <i>Nos G&rsquo;lan
Geua</i>&rsquo;, or All-Hallows&rsquo; Eve, and waited there until
midnight, when they would hear the Spirit announce the death roll for the
coming year.&nbsp; Should, however, no voice be heard, it was a sign that
no death would occur within the twelve succeeding months.&nbsp; A couple of
tales shall suffice as illustrative of this superstition.</p>
<h4><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span><i>A Spirit in Aberhafesp Church announcing the death of a person
on Nos G&rsquo;lan Geua&rsquo;</i>.</h4>
<p>Mr. Breeze, late governor of the Union House at Caersws, told me that he
had heard of a person going to Aberhafesp Church porch, on
All-Hallows&rsquo; Eve, to ascertain whether there would be a death in that
parish in the coming year.</p>
<p>A couple of men, one of whom, I believe, Mr. Breeze said was his
relative, went to the church porch before twelve o&rsquo;clock at night,
and sat there a length of time without hearing any sound in the church; but
about the midnight hour, one of the men distinctly heard the name of his
companion uttered by a voice within the church.&nbsp; He was greatly
terrified, and, addressing his friend, he found that he had fallen asleep,
and that, therefore, fortunately he had not heard the ominous voice.&nbsp;
Awaking his companion, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go away, it&rsquo;s
no use waiting here any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of a few weeks, there was a funeral from the opposite
parish of Penstrowed, and the departed was to be buried in Aberhafesp
Church yard.&nbsp; The River Severn runs between these two parishes, and
there is no bridge nearer than that which spans the river at Caersws, and
to take the funeral that way would mean a journey of more than five
miles.&nbsp; It was determined, therefore, to ford the river opposite
Aberhafesp Church.&nbsp; The person who had fallen asleep in the porch
volunteered to carry the coffin over the river, and it was placed on the
saddle in front of this person, who, to save it from falling, was obliged
to grasp it with both arms; and, as the deceased had died of an infectious
fever, the coffin bearer was stricken, and within a week he too was a dead
man, and he was the first parishioner, as foretold by the Spirit, who died
in the parish of Aberhafesp that year.</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>According to Croker, in <i>Fairy Legends of Ireland</i>, vol.
II., p. 288, the Irish at Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, after
decorating the graves of their ancestors:&mdash;&ldquo;Also listen at the
church door in the dark, when they sometimes fancy they hear the names
called over in church of those who are destined shortly to join their lost
relatives in the tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not difficult to multiply instances of Spirits speaking in
churches, for legendary stories of this kind were attached to, or were
related of, many churches in Wales.&nbsp; One further tale therefore, shall
suffice.</p>
<h4><i>A Spirit in Llangerniew Church</i>, <i>Denbighshire</i>.</h4>
<p>There was a tradition in this parish that on All-Hallows&rsquo; Eve a
Spirit announced from the altar the names of those who were doomed to die
in the coming year.&nbsp; The Spirit was locally called
<i>Angelystor</i>.&nbsp; Those who were anxious to know whether they or
their neighbours had a longer time to live stood underneath the east window
on that eve, and anxiously listened for the dreaded revelation.&nbsp; It is
related of a tailor, who was reckoned a wit, and affected disbelief in the
Spirit story, that he announced his intention to prove the thing a myth,
and so, one <i>Nos G&rsquo;lan Geua&rsquo;</i>, Shon Robert, as he was
called, proceeded to the church just before midnight, and, to his horror,
he heard his own name&mdash;&ldquo;Shon ap Robert,&rdquo; uttered by the
Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold, hold!&rdquo; said the tailor, &ldquo;I am not
quite ready!&rdquo;&nbsp; But, ready or not ready, it made no difference to
the messenger of death, for that year the tailor died.</p>
<p>According to rustic opinion, demons were, from sinister motives, much
given to frequenting churches; still it was thought that as the Priest
entered the sacred building by the south door these Spirits were obliged to
make their exit through the north door, which was called in consequence the
Devil&rsquo;s Door; and this door was opened, and left open <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>awhile, to
enable these Evil Spirits to escape from the church, before divine service
commenced.&nbsp; In agreement with this notion, the north side of church
yards was designated the Domain of Demons, and, by association of ideas, no
one formerly was buried in this side, but in our days the north part of the
church yard&mdash;where the space in the other parts has already been
occupied&mdash;is used for interments, and the north doors in most old
churches have been built up.</p>
<p>Formerly, at baptisms, the north church door was, in Wales, left open,
and that too for the same reason that it was opened before the hours of
prayer.&nbsp; But these superstitions have departed, as intimated by the
blocking up of north church doors.</p>
<h4><i>Satan and Bell Ringing</i>.</h4>
<p>Durand, according to Bourne, in his <i>Antiquities of the Common
People</i>, ed. 1725, p. 17, was of opinion that Devils were much afraid of
bells, and fled away at the sound of them.&nbsp; Formerly, in all parts of
Wales, the passing bell was tolled for the dying.&nbsp; This is a very
ancient custom being alluded to by the Venerable Bede&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the bell begins to toll,<br />
Lord, have mercy on the soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small hand bell was also rung by the parish clerk as he preceded the
funeral procession, and the church bell was tolled before, at, and after
the burial.&nbsp; I do not know whether this was done because the people,
entertaining Durand&rsquo;s opinion, wished to save the souls and bodies of
their departed friends from Satan.&nbsp; Reference is often made to small
handbells in parish terriers, and they are enumerated in those documents
with other church property.&nbsp; Thus, in Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd terrier,
1729, among the articles mentioned as belonging to the church is a small
bell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;A little bell to be rung before the corps.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Rhuddlan terrier, 1791, we find:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One small bell, and another small corps bell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may say that there is hardly a terrier belonging to a Church in North
Wales which does not mention this portable handbell.&nbsp; Although the
modern reason given for their use at funerals was, that all impediments
might be removed from the roads before the funeral procession arrived,
still it is probable that the custom at one time meant something more than
this.&nbsp; The custom does not at present exist.</p>
<p><i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i> thus alludes to these handbells:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I must not omit that the portable bells . . . were held in great
reverence by the people and clergy both in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales;
insomuch that they had greater regard for oaths sworn on these than on the
gospels.&rdquo;&mdash;Bohn&rsquo;s Edition, p. 146.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it was thought that the Passing Bell was originally intended to drive
away the Evil Spirit hovering about in readiness to seize the soul of the
deceased, so it might have been thought that the tolling of these handbells
at funerals kept the Great Enemy away from the body about to be consigned
to consecrated ground.&nbsp; But from a couple of lines quoted by Bourne,
p. 14, from Spelman, in which all the ancient offices of bells seem to be
included, it does not appear that this opinion was then current.&nbsp; The
lines are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laudo Deum verum, Plebem voco, congrego Clerum,<br />
Defunctos ploro, pestem fugo, Festa decoro.</p>
<p>I praise the true God, call the people, convene the Clergy,<br />
Lament the dead, dispel pestilence, grace Festivals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing in these lines corroborative of Durand&rsquo;s opinion,
but as I do not know the age of the lines I cannot controvert his opinion,
but if it was believed that the tolling of a bell could drive away
pestilence, well can it be <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>understood that its sound could be credited
with being inimical to Evil Spirits, and that it sent them away to other
places to seek for rest.</p>
<p>It certainly was an opinion, according to Croker, entertained in Ireland
and elsewhere, that the dwarfs or fairies, were driven away from places by
the ringing of the bells of churches, and Croker in his <i>Fairy Legends of
Ireland</i>, vol. ii., p. 106, states that Thiele collected traditions
according to which the Troldes leave the country on the ringing of bells,
and remain away.&nbsp; Thus these mythic beings are confounded with Satan;
indeed Croker remarks (vol. i., p. 46) &ldquo;The notion of fairies,
dwarfs, brownies, etc., being excluded from salvation, and of their having
formed part of the crew that fell with Satan, seems to be pretty general
all over Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He instances Ireland, Denmark, and Spain.</p>
<p>Bells certainly were objects of great superstition.&nbsp; In
Dyer&rsquo;s <i>English Folk-Lore</i>, p. 264, it is stated
that&mdash;Wynkin de Worde tells us that bells are rung during thunder
storms, to the end that fiends and wicked Spirits should be abashed and
flee and cease the moving of the tempest.</p>
<p>Croker also remarks in vol. ii., p. 140, of the above-named
work:&mdash;&ldquo;The belief in fairies and Spirits prevailed over all
Europe long before the introduction of Christianity.&nbsp; The teachers of
the new faith endeavoured to abolish the deeply-rooted heathenish ideas and
customs of the people, by representing them as sinful and connected with
the Devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this way the Devil inherited many attributes
that once belonged to the Fairies, and these beings were spoken of as Evil
Spirits, Fiends, or Devils.</p>
<p>I now come to another kind of Welsh Folk-Lore associated with fairies,
Evil Spirits, or some mysterious power, that is the removal of churches
from one site to another.&nbsp; The agency employed varies, but the work of
the <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>day disappeared in the night, and the materials were found, it is
said, the next morning, on the spot where the church was to be erected.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Removal of Churches.</h3>
<h4>I.&nbsp; LLANLLECHID CHURCH.</h4>
<p>There was a tradition extant in the parish of Llanllechid, near Bangor,
Carnarvonshire, that it was intended to build a church in a field called
Cae&rsquo;r Capel, not far from Plasuchaf Farm, but it was found the next
morning that the labours of the previous day had been destroyed, and that
the materials had been transported in the night to the site of the present
church.&nbsp; The workmen, however, carried them all back again, and
resumed their labours at Cae&rsquo;r Capel, but in vain, for the next day
they found their work undone, and the wood, stones, etc., in the place
where they had found them when their work was first tampered with.&nbsp;
Seeing that it was useless fighting against a superior power, they
desisted, and erected the building on the spot indicated by the destroyers
of their labours.</p>
<p>I asked the aged, what or who it was that had carried away the
materials: some said it was done by Spirits, others by Fairies, but I could
obtain no definite information on the point.&nbsp; However, they all agreed
that the present site was more convenient for the parishioners than the old
one.</p>
<p>Many legends of this kind are current in Wales.&nbsp; They are all much
alike in general outline.&nbsp; A few only therefore shall be
mentioned.</p>
<h4>II.&nbsp; CORWEN CHURCH.</h4>
<p>In Thomas&rsquo;s <i>History of the Diocese of St. Asaph</i>, p. 687,
the legend connected with the erection of the present church is given as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The legend of its (Corwen Church) original foundation
states that all attempts to build the church in any other spot than where
stood the <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&rsquo;Carreg y Big yn y fach rewlyd,&rsquo; i.e., &lsquo;The
pointed stone in the icy nook,&rsquo; were frustrated by the influence of
certain adverse powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No agency is mentioned in this narrative.&nbsp; When questioned on such
a matter, the aged, of forty years ago, would shake their heads in an
ominous kind of manner, and remain silent, as if it were wrong on their
part to allude to the affair.&nbsp; Others, more bold, would surmise that
it was the work of a Spirit, or of the Fairies.&nbsp; By and by I shall
give Mr. A. N. Palmer&rsquo;s solution of the mystery.</p>
<h4>III.&nbsp; CAPEL GARMON CHURCH.</h4>
<p>A legend much like the preceding is current respecting Capel Garmon
Church.&nbsp; I will give the story in the words of my friend, the Rev.
Owen Jones, Pentrevoelas, who writes to me thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tradition is that Capel Garmon Church was to have been built
on the side of the mountain just above the present village, near the Well
now called Ffynnon Armon, but the materials carried there in the daytime
were in a mysterious manner conveyed by night to the present site of the
church.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>IV.&nbsp; LLANFAIR DYFFRYN CLWYD.</h4>
<p>For the following legend, I am indebted to Mr. R. Prys Jones, who
resided for several years in the parish of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd.&nbsp; In
answer to a letter from me respecting mysterious removal of churches, Mr.
Jones writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the same tradition in connection with a place not very
far from Llanfair village.&nbsp; It was first intended to erect Llanfair
Church on the spot where Jesus Chapel now stands, or very near to it.&nbsp;
Tradition ascribes the failure of erecting the structure to a phantom in
the shape of <i>a sow&rsquo;s head</i>, destroying in the night what had
been built during <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>the day.&nbsp; The farm house erected on the
land is still called <i>Llanbenwch</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Llan-pen-hwch, i.e.,
the <i>Llan</i>, <i>or church</i>, <i>of the Sow&rsquo;s Head</i>.</p>
<p>In this tale the agent is a sow, and Mr. Gomme in the <i>Antiquary</i>,
vol. iii. p. 9, records a like story of Winwick Parish Church,
Lancashire.&nbsp; He states that the founder had destined a different site
for this church, &ldquo;but after progress had been made at the original
foundation, at night time, &lsquo;a pig&rsquo; was seen running hastily to
the site of the new church, crying or screaming aloud We-ee-wick,
we-ee-wick, we-ee-wick.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then taking up a stone in his mouth he
carried it to the spot sanctified by the death of St. Oswald, and thus
succeeded in removing all the stones which had been laid by the
builders.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>V.&nbsp; LLANFIHANGEL GENEU&rsquo;R GLYN.</h4>
<p>The traveller who has gone to Aberystwyth by the Cambrian Line has, most
probably, noticed on the left hand side, shortly after he has left Borth, a
small church, with a churchyard that enters a wood to the west of the
church, the grave stones being seen among the trees.&nbsp; There is in
connection with this church a legend much like those already given.&nbsp; I
am indebted to the Rev. J. Felix, vicar of Cilcen, near Mold, for the
following account of the transaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was intended to build Llanfihangel Church at a place called
Glanfread, or Glanfread-fawr, which at present is a respectable farm house,
and the work was actually commenced on that spot, but the portion built
during the day was pulled down each night, till at last a Spirit spoke in
these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llanfihangel Geneu&rsquo;r Glyn,<br />
Glanfread-fawr gaiff fod fan hyn.<br />
Llanfihangel Geneu&rsquo;r Glyn,<br />
Glanfread-fawr shall stand herein,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>intimating that the church was to be built at Geneu&rsquo;r Glyn,
and that Glanfreadfawr farm house was to occupy the place where they were
then endeavouring to build the church.&nbsp; The prophecy, or warning, was
attended to, and the church erection abandoned, but the work was carried
out at Geneu&rsquo;r Glyn, in accordance with the Spirit&rsquo;s direction,
and the church was built in its present position.</p>
<h4>VI.&nbsp; WREXHAM CHURCH.</h4>
<p>The following extract is from Mr. A. Neobard Palmer&rsquo;s excellent
<i>History of the Parish Church of Wrexham</i>, p. 6:&mdash;&ldquo;There is
a curious local tradition, which, <i>as I understand it</i>, points
distinctly to a re-erection of one of the earlier churches on a site
different from that on which the church preceding it had stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the tradition just mentioned, which was collected
and first published by the late Mr. Hugh Davies, the attempt to build the
church on another spot (at Bryn-y-ffynnon as &rsquo;t is said), was
constantly frustrated, that which was set up during the day being plucked
down in the night.&nbsp; At last, one night when the work wrought on the
day before was being watched, the wardens saw it thrown suddenly down, and
heard a voice proceeding from a Spirit hovering above them which cried ever
&lsquo;Bryn-y-grog!&rsquo; &lsquo;Bryn-y-grog!&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the site of
the present church was at that time called &lsquo;Bryn-y-grog&rsquo; (Hill
of the Cross), and it was at once concluded that this was the spot on which
the church should be built.&nbsp; The occupier of this spot, however, was
exceedingly unwilling to part with the inheritance of his forefathers, and
could only be induced to do so when the story which has just been related
was told to him, and other land given him instead.&nbsp; The church was
then founded at &lsquo;Bryn-y-grog,&rsquo; where the progress of the work
suffered no interruption, and where the Church of Wrexham still
stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Mr. Palmer, having remarked that there is a striking resemblance
between all the traditions of churches removed mysteriously, proceeds to
solve the difficulty, in these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conclusions which occurred to me were, that these stories
contain a record, imaginative and exaggerated, of real incidents connected
with the history of the churches to which each of them belongs, and that
they are <i>in most cases</i> reminiscences <i>of an older church which
once actually stood on another site</i>.&nbsp; The destroying powers of
which they all speak were probably human agents, working in the interest of
those who were concerned in the transference of the site of the church
about to be re-built; while the stories, as a whole, were apparently
concocted and circulated with the intention of overbearing the opposition
which the proposed transference raised&mdash;an opposition due to the
inconvenience of the site proposed, to sacred associations connected with
the older site, or to the unwillingness of the occupier to surrender the
spot selected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is, as everything Mr. Palmer writes, pertinent, and it is a
reasonable solution, but whether it can be made to apply to all cases is
somewhat doubtful.&nbsp; Perhaps we have not sufficient data to arrive at a
correct explanation of this kind of myth.&nbsp; The objection was to the
<i>place</i> selected and not to the <i>building</i> about to be erected on
that spot; and the <i>agents</i> engaged in the destruction of the proposed
edifice differ in different places; and in many instances, where these
traditions exist, the land around, as regards agricultural uses, was
equally useful, or equally useless, and often the distance between the two
sites is not great, and the land in our days, at least, and presumably in
former, belonged to the same proprietor&mdash;if indeed it had a proprietor
at all.&nbsp; We must, therefore, I think, look <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>outside the occupier
of the land for objections to the surrender of the spot first selected as
the site of the new church.</p>
<p>Mr. Gomme, in an able article in the <i>Antiquary</i>, vol. iii., p.
8-13, on &ldquo;Some traditions and superstitions connected with
buildings,&rdquo; gives many typical examples of buildings removed by
unseen agencies, and, from the fact that these stories are found in
England, Scotland, and other parts, he rightly infers that they had a
common origin, and that they take us back to primitive times of British
history.&nbsp; The cause of the removal of the stones in those early times,
or first stage of their history, is simply described as <i>invisible
agency</i>, <i>witches</i>, <i>fairies</i>; in the second stage of these
myths, the supernatural agency becomes more clearly defined,
thus:&mdash;<i>doves</i>, <i>a pig</i>, <i>a cat</i>, <i>a fish</i>, <i>a
bull</i>, do the work of demolishing the buildings, and Mr. Gomme remarks
with reference to these animals:&mdash;&ldquo;Now here we have some glimmer
of light thrown upon the subject&mdash;the introduction of animal life
leads to the subject of animal sacrifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will not follow
Mr. Gomme in this part of his dissertation, but I will remark that the
agencies he mentions as belonging to the first stage are identical in
Wales, England, and Scotland, and we have an example of the second stage in
Wales, in the traditions of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, and of Llangar Church,
near Corwen.</p>
<h4>VII.&nbsp; LLANGAR CHURCH.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The tradition is that Llangar Church was to have been built near
the spot where the Cynwyd Bridge crosses the Dee.&nbsp; Indeed, we are told
that the masons set to work, but all the stones they laid in the day were
gone during the night none knew whither.&nbsp; The builders were warned,
supernaturally, that they must seek a spot where on hunting a &lsquo;Carw
Gwyn&rsquo; (white stag) would be started.&nbsp; They did <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>so, and
Llangar Church is the result.&nbsp; From this circumstance the church was
called Llan-garw-gwyn, and from this name the transition to Llangar is
easy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Gossiping Guide to Wales</i>, p. 128.</p>
<p>I find in a document written by the Rural Dean for the guidance of the
Bishop of St. Asaph, in 1729, that the stag was started in a thicket where
the Church of Llangar now stands.&nbsp; &ldquo;And (as the tradition is)
the boundaries of the parish on all sides were settled for &rsquo;em by
this poor deer, where he was forc&rsquo;d to run for his life, there lye
their bounds.&nbsp; He at last fell, and the place where he was killed is
to this day called <i>Moel y Lladdfa</i>, or the <i>Hill of
Slaughter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>VIII.&nbsp; ST. DAVID&rsquo;S CHURCH, DENBIGH.</h4>
<p>There is a tradition connected with Old St. David&rsquo;s Church,
Denbigh, recorded in Gee&rsquo;s <i>Guide to Denbigh</i>, that the building
could not be completed, because whatever portion was finished in the day
time was pulled down and carried to another place at night by some
invisible hand, or supernatural power.</p>
<p>The party who malignantly frustrates the builders&rsquo; designs is in
several instances said to have been the Devil.&nbsp; &ldquo;We find,&rdquo;
says Mr. William Crossing, in the <i>Antiquary</i>, vol. iv., p. 34,
&ldquo;that the Church of Plymton St. Mary, has connected with it the
legend so frequently attached to ecclesiastical buildings, of the removal
by the <i>Enemy of Mankind</i> of the building materials by night, from the
spot chosen for its erection to another at some distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again, Mr A. N. Palmer, quoting in the <i>Antiquary</i>, vol. iv.,
p. 34, what was said at the meeting of the British Association, in 1878, by
Mr. Peckover, respecting the detached Tower of the Church of West Walton,
near Wisbech, Norfolk, writes:&mdash;&ldquo;During the early days of that
<!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>Church the Fenmen were very wicked, and the <i>Evil Spirit</i>
hired a number of people to carry the tower away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. W. S. Lach-Szyrma, in the <i>Antiquary</i>, vol. iii., p. 188,
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Legends of <i>the Enemy of Mankind</i> and some old
buildings are numerous enough&mdash;e.g., it is said that as the masons
built up the towers of Towednack Church, near St. Ives, the <i>Devil</i>
knocked the stones down; hence its dwarfed dimensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preceding stories justify me in relegating this kind of myth to the
same class as those in which spirits are driven from churches and
<i>laid</i> in a neighbouring pool; and perhaps in these latter, as in the
former, is dimly seen traces of the antagonism, in remote times, between
peoples holding different religious beliefs, and the steps taken by one
party to seize and appropriate the sacred spots of the other.</p>
<h3>Apparitions of the Devil.</h3>
<p>To accomplish his nefarious designs the Evil Spirit assumed forms
calculated to attain his object.&nbsp; The following lines from Allan
Cunningham&rsquo;s <i>Traditional Tales</i>, p. 9, aptly describe his
transformations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  Soon he shed<br />
His hellish slough, and many a subtle wile<br />
Was his to seem a heavenly spirit to man,<br />
First, he a hermit, sore subdued in flesh,<br />
O&rsquo;er a cold cruse of water and a crust,<br />
Poured out meet prayers abundant.&nbsp; Then he changed<br />
Into a maid when she first dreams of man,<br />
And from beneath two silken eyelids sent,<br />
The sidelong light of two such wondrous eyes,<br />
That all the saints grew sinners . . .<br />
Then a professor of God&rsquo;s word he seemed,<br />
And o&rsquo;er a multitude of upturned eyes<br />
Showered blessed dews, and made the pitchy path,<br />
Down which howl damn&eacute;d Spirits, seem the bright<br />
Thrice hallowed way to Heaven; yet grimly through<br />
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>The glorious veil of those seducing shapes,<br />
Frowned out the fearful Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S. Anthony, in the wilderness, as related in his life by S. Athanasius,
had many conflicts in the night with the powers of darkness, Satan
appearing personally to him, to batter him from the strongholds of his
faith.&nbsp; S. Dunstan, in his cell, was tempted by the Devil in the form
of a lovely woman, but a grip of his nose with a heated tongs made him
bellow out, and cease his nightly visits to that holy man.&nbsp; Ezra
Peden, as related by Allan Cunningham, was also tempted by one who
&ldquo;was indeed passing fair,&rdquo; and the longer he looked on her she
became the lovelier&mdash;&ldquo;<i>owre lovely for mere flesh and
blood</i>,&rdquo; and poor Peden succumbed to her wiles.</p>
<p>From the book of Tobit it would appear that an Evil Spirit slew the
first seven husbands of Sara from jealousy and lust, in the vain hope of
securing her for himself.&nbsp; In Giraldus Cambrensis&rsquo;s <i>Itinerary
through Wales</i>, Bohn&rsquo;s ed., p. 411 demons are shown to possess
those qualities which are ascribed to them in the Apocryphal book of
Tobit.</p>
<p>There is nothing new, as far as I am aware, respecting the doings of the
Great Enemy of mankind in Welsh Folk-Lore.&nbsp; His tactics in the
Principality evince no originality.&nbsp; They are the usual weapons used
by him everywhere, and these he found to be sufficient for his purposes
even in Wales.</p>
<p>Gladly would I here put down my pen and leave the uncongenial task of
treating further about the spirits of darkness to others, but were I to do
so, I should be guilty of a grave omission, for, as I have already said,
ghosts, goblins, spirits, and other beings allied to Satan, occupy a
prominent place in Welsh Folk-Lore.</p>
<p>Of a winter&rsquo;s evening, by the faint light of a peat fire and rush
candles, our forefathers recounted the weird stories of <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>olden times, of
devils, fairies, ghosts, witches, apparitions, giants, hidden treasures,
and other cognate subjects, and they delighted in implanting terrors in the
minds of the listeners that no philosophy, nor religion of after years,
could entirely eradicate.&nbsp; These tales made a strong impression upon
the imagination, and possibly upon the conduct of the people, and hence the
necessity laid upon me to make a further selection of the many tales that I
have collected on this subject.</p>
<p>I will begin with a couple of stories extracted from the work of the
Rev. Edmund Jones, by a writer in the <i>Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. ii., p.
276.</p>
<h3>Satan appearing to a Man who was fetching a Load of Bibles,
etc.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A Mr. Henry Llewelyn, having been sent to Samuel Davies, of
Ystrad Defodoc Parish, in Glamorganshire, to fetch a load of books, viz.,
Bibles, Testaments, Watts&rsquo;s Psalms, Hymns, and Songs for Children,
said&mdash;Coming home by night towards Mynyddustwyn, having just passed by
Clwyd yr Helygen ale-house, and being in a dry part of the lane&mdash;the
mare, which he rode, stood still, and, like the ass of the ungodly Balaam,
would go no farther, but kept drawing back.&nbsp; Presently he could see a
living thing, round like a bowl, rolling from the right hand to the left,
and crossing the lane, moving sometimes slow and sometimes very
swift&mdash;yea, swifter than a bird could fly, though it had neither wings
nor feet,&mdash;altering also its size.&nbsp; It appeared three times, less
one time than another, seemed least when near him, and appeared to roll
towards the mare&rsquo;s belly.&nbsp; The mare would then want to go
forward, but he stopped her, to see more carefully what manner of thing it
was.&nbsp; He staid, as he thought, about three minutes, to look at it;
but, fearing to see a worse sight, he thought it <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>high time to speak to
it, and said&mdash;&lsquo;What seekest thou, thou foul thing?&nbsp; In the
name of the Lord Jesus, go away!&rsquo;&nbsp; And by speaking this it
vanished, and sank into the ground near the mare&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; It
appeared to be of a <i>reddish oak colour</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a footnote to this tale we are told that formerly near Clwyd yr
Helygen, the Lord&rsquo;s Day was greatly profaned, and &ldquo;it may be
that the Adversary was wroth at the good books and the bringer of them; for
he well knew what burden the mare carried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor of the <i>Cambro-Briton</i> remarks that the superstitions
recorded, if authentic, &ldquo;are not very creditable to the intelligence
of our lower classes in Wales; but it is some satisfaction to think that
none of them are of recent date.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter remark was, I am
sorry to say, rather premature.</p>
<p>One other quotation from the same book I will here make.</p>
<h3>The Devil appearing to a Dissenting Minister at Denbigh.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Thomas Baddy, who lived in Denbigh Town, and was a
Dissenting Minister in that place, went into his study one night, and while
he was reading or writing, he heard some one behind him laughing and
grinning at him, which made him stop a little&mdash;as well indeed it
might.&nbsp; It came again, and then he wrote on a piece of paper, that
devil-wounding scripture, 1st John, 3rd,&mdash;&lsquo;For this was the Son
of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the
Devil,&rsquo;&mdash;and held it backwards from him, when the laughing
ceased for ever; for it was a melancholy word to a scoffing Devil, and
enough to damp him.&nbsp; It would have damped him yet more, if he had
shewn him James, ii. 19&mdash;&lsquo;The devils believe and
tremble.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he had enough for one time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>The following objectless tale, still extant, I believe, in the
mountainous parts of Denbighshire, is another instance of the credulity in
former days of the people.</p>
<h3>Satan seen Lying right across a Road.</h3>
<p>The story related to me was as follows:&mdash;Near Pentrevoelas lived a
man called John Ty&rsquo;nllidiart, who was in the habit of taking, yearly,
cattle from the uplands in his neighbourhood, to be wintered in the Vale of
Clwyd.&nbsp; Once, whilst thus engaged, he saw lying across the road right
in front of him and the cattle, and completely blocking up the way, Satan
with his head on one wall and his tail on the other, moaning
horribly.&nbsp; John, as might be expected, hurried homewards, leaving his
charge to take their chance with the Evil One, but long before he came to
his house, the odour of brimstone had preceded him, and his wife was only
too glad to find that it was her husband that came through the door, for
she thought that it was someone else that was approaching.</p>
<h3>The Devil&rsquo;s Tree by Eglwys Rhos, near
Llandudno.</h3>
<p>At the corner of the first turning after passing the village of
Llanrhos, on the left hand side, is a withered oak tree, called by the
natives of those parts the Devil&rsquo;s Tree, and it was thought to be
haunted, and therefore the young and timid were afraid to pass it of a dark
night.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. Arthur Jones, late Curate of the parish, told me that his
horse was in the habit of shying whenever it came opposite this blighted
tree, and his servant accounted for this by saying that the horse saw
something there which was invisible to the sight of man.&nbsp; Be this as
it may, the tree has an uncanny appearance and a bad reputation, which some
years ago was greatly increased by an occurrence that happened there to
Cadwaladr Williams, a shoemaker, who lived at Llansantffraid Glan
Conway.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Cadwaladr was in the habit of carrying his work home to Llandudno
to his customers every Saturday night in a wallet, and with the money which
they paid him he bought eatables for the coming week, and carried shoes to
be patched in one end of the wallet, and groceries, etc., in the other end,
and, by adjusting the wallet he balanced it, and carried it, over his
shoulders, home again.</p>
<p>This shoemaker sometimes refreshed himself too freely before starting
homewards from Llandudno, and he was in the habit of turning into the
public house at Llanrhos to gain courage to pass the Devil&rsquo;s
Tree.</p>
<p>One Saturday night, instead of quietly passing this tree on the other
side, he walked fearlessly up to it, and defied the Evil One to appear if
he were there.&nbsp; No sooner had he uttered the defiant words than
something fell from the tree, and lit upon his shoulders, and grasped poor
Cadwaladr&rsquo;s neck with a grip of iron.&nbsp; He fought with the
incubus savagely to get rid of it, but all his exertions were in vain, and
so he was obliged to proceed on his journey with this fearful thing
clinging to him, which became heavier and heavier every step he took.&nbsp;
At last, thoroughly exhausted, he came to Towyn, and, more dead than alive,
he reached a friend&rsquo;s door and knocked, and oh, what pleasure, before
the door was opened the weight on his back had gone, but his friend knew
who it was that Cadwaladr had carried from the Devil&rsquo;s Tree.</p>
<h3>Satan appearing as a Lovely Maiden.</h3>
<p>The following story I received from the Rev. Owen Jones,
Pentrevoelas.&nbsp; As regards details it is a fragment.</p>
<p>A young man who was walking from Dyserth to Rhyl was overtaken by a
lovely young lady dressed in white.&nbsp; She invited conversation, and
they walked together awhile talking kindly, but, when they came opposite a
pool on the <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>road side she disappeared, in the form of a ball of fire, into
the water.</p>
<p>All that has reached our days, in corroboration of this tale, is the
small pool.</p>
<p>The next tale was told me by the Rev. R. Jones, Rector of
Llanycil.&nbsp; Mr. Jones gave names and localities, which I have indicated
by initials.</p>
<h3>A Man carried away by the Evil One.</h3>
<p>W. E., of Ll--- M---, was a very bad man; he was a brawler, a fighter, a
drunkard.&nbsp; He is said to have spat in the parson&rsquo;s face, and to
have struck him, and beaten the parish clerk who interfered.&nbsp; It was
believed that he had sold himself to work evil, and many foul deeds he
committed, and, what was worse, he gloried in them.</p>
<p>People thought that his end would be a shocking one, and they were not
disappointed.&nbsp; One night this reprobate and stubborn character did not
return home.&nbsp; The next day search was made for him, and his dead body
was found on the brink of the river.&nbsp; Upon inspecting the ground, it
became evident that the deceased had had a desperate struggle with an
unknown antagonist, and the battle commenced some distance above the
<i>ceunant</i>, or <i>dingle</i>, where the body was discovered.&nbsp; It
was there seen that the man had planted his heels deep into the ground, as
if to resist a superior force, intent upon dragging him down to the
river.&nbsp; There were indications that he had lost his footing; but a few
yards lower down it was observed that his feet had ploughed the ground, and
every step taken from this spot was traceable all down the declivity to the
bottom of the ravine, and every yard gave proof that a desperate and
prolonged struggle had taken place along the whole course.&nbsp; In one
place an oak tree intercepted the way, and it was seen that a bough had its
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>bark peeled off, and evidently the wretched man had taken hold of
this bough and did not let go until the bark came off in his hands, for in
death he still clutched the bark.&nbsp; The last and most severe struggle
took place close to the river, and here the body was dragged underneath the
roots of a tree, through a hole not big enough for a child to creep
through, and this ended the fight.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones stated that what was most remarkable and ominous in connection
with this foul work was the fact that, although footprints were seen in the
ground, they were all those of the miserable man, for there were no other
marks visible.&nbsp; From this fact and the previous evil life of this
wretched creature, the people in those parts believed that the fearful
struggle had taken place between W. E. and the Evil One, and that he had
not been murdered by any man, but that he was taken away by Satan.</p>
<p>The next tale is a type of many once common in Wales, and as in one
respect it connects these tales, or at least this particular one, with
Fairy stories, I will relate it.</p>
<h3>Satan appearing to a Young Man.</h3>
<p>A young man, who had left Pentrevoelas to live in a farm house called
Hafod Elwy, had to go over the hills to Denbigh on business.&nbsp; He
started very early, before the cock crew, and as it was winter, his journey
over the bleak moorlands was dismal and dreary.&nbsp; When he had proceeded
several miles on his journey an unaccountable dread crept over him.&nbsp;
He tried to dispel his fear by whistling and by knocking the ground with
his walking stick, but all in vain.&nbsp; He stopped, and thought of
returning home, but this he could not do, for he was more afraid of the
ridicule of his friends than of his own fear, and therefore he proceeded on
his journey and reached Pont Brenig, where he stopped <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>awhile, and listened,
thinking he might see or hear someone approaching.&nbsp; To his horror, he
observed, through the glimmering light of the coming day, a tall gentleman
approaching, and by a great exertion he mastered his feelings so far as to
enable him to walk towards the stranger, but when within a few yards of him
he stood still, for from fright he could not move.&nbsp; He noticed that
the gentleman wore grey clothes, and breeches fastened with yellow buckles,
on his coat were two rows of buttons like gold, his shoes were low, with
bright clasps to them.&nbsp; Strange to say, this gentleman did not pass
the terrified man, but stepped into the bog and disappeared from view.</p>
<p>Ever afterwards, when this man passed the spot where he had met the Evil
One, he found there money or other valuables.&nbsp; This latter incident
connects this tale with Fairy Folk-Lore, as the Fair People were credited
with bestowing gifts on mortals.</p>
<h3>Satan appearing to a Collier.</h3>
<p>John Roberts of Colliers&rsquo; Row, Cyfartha, Merthyr, was once going
to Aberdare over the mountain.&nbsp; On the top of the hill he was met by a
handsome gentleman, who wore a three-cocked hat, a red waistcoat, and a
blue coat.&nbsp; The appearance of this well dressed man took John
Roberts&rsquo;s fancy; but he could not understand why he should be alone
on Aberdare mountain, and, furthermore, why he did not know the way to
Aberdare, for he had asked Roberts to direct him to the town.&nbsp; John
stared at the gentleman, and saw clearly a cloven foot and a long tail
protruding underneath the blue coat, and there and then the gentleman
changed himself into a <i>pig</i>, which stood before John, gave a big
grunt, and then ran away.</p>
<p>I received the story from a lady to whom Roberts related it.</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>All these tales belong to modern times, and some of them appear
to be objectless as well as ridiculous.</p>
<p>There are a few places in Wales which take their names from Satan.&nbsp;
The <i>Devil&rsquo;s Bridge</i> is so called from the tradition that it was
erected by him upon the condition that the first thing that passed over it
should be his.&nbsp; In his design he was balked, for his intended victim,
who was accompanied by his faithful dog, threw a piece of bread across the
bridge after which the dog ran, and thus became the Devil&rsquo;s property,
but this victim Satan would not take.</p>
<p><i>The Devil&rsquo;s Kitchen</i> is a chasm in the rock on the west side
of Llyn Idwal, Carnarvonshire.&nbsp; The view through this opening, looking
downwards towards Ogwen Lake, is sublime, and, notwithstanding its uncanny
name, the Kitchen is well worthy of a visit from lovers of nature.</p>
<p>From the following quotation, taken from <i>Y Gordofigion</i>, p. 110,
it would appear that there is a rock on the side of Cader Idris called
after the Evil One.&nbsp; The words are:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mae ar dir Rhiwogo, ar ochr Cader Idris, graig a elwir.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Careg-gwr-drwg</i>,&rsquo; byth ar ol y Sabboth hwnw pan ddaeth
yno at drigolion plwyfydd Llanfihangel Pennant ac Ystradgwyn, pan oeddynt
wedi ymgasglu i chwareu cardiau, a dawnsio; ac y rhoddodd dro o amgylch y
graig gan ddawnsio, ac y mae ol ei draed ar y graig eto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This in English is as follows:&mdash;There is on the land belonging to
Rhiwogo, on the side of Cader Idris, a rock called <i>The Rock of the Evil
One</i>, so named ever after that Sabbath, when he came there to join the
parishioners of Llanfihangel Pennant and Ystradgwyn, who had gathered
together to play cards and dance, and there he danced around the rock, and
to this day the marks of his feet are to be seen in the rock.</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>There were, perhaps are, in Pembrokeshire, two stones, called the
Devil&rsquo;s Nags, which were haunted by Evil Spirits, who troubled the
people that passed that way.</p>
<p><i>Ceubren yr Ellyll</i>, the Hobgoblin&rsquo;s Hollow Tree, a noble
oak, once ornamented Nannau Park, Merionethshire.&nbsp; Tradition says that
it was within the trunk of this tree that Glyndwr buried his cousin, Howel
Sele, who fell a victim to the superior strength and skill of his
relative.&nbsp; Ever after that sad occurrence the place was troubled,
sounds proceeded out of the tree, and fire hovered over it, and, according
to a writer in <i>The Cambro-Briton</i>, vol. i., p. 226:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E&rsquo;en to this day, the peasant still<br />
&nbsp;  With cautious fear treads o&rsquo;er the ground;<br />
In each wild bush a spectre sees,<br />
&nbsp;  And trembles at each rising sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the caves in Little Orme&rsquo;s Head, Llandudno, is known as
<i>Ogof Cythreuliaid</i>, the Cave of Devils.</p>
<p>From the preceding names of places, which do not by any means exhaust
the list, it will be seen that many romantic spots in Wales are associated
with Demons.</p>
<p>There are also sayings in Welsh connected with the Evil One.&nbsp; Thus,
in our days may be heard, when it rains and the sun shines at the same
time, the expression, &ldquo;<i>Mae&rsquo;r Gwr Drwg yn waldio&rsquo;i
wraig</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the Devil is beating his wife.</p>
<p>Besides the Biblical names, by which Satan is known, in Wales, there are
several others in use, not to be found in the Bible, but it would seem that
these names are borrowed being either importations or translations; in
fact, it is doubtful, whether we possess any exclusively Welsh terms
applied solely to the Devil.&nbsp; <i>Andras</i> or <i>Andros</i> is common
in North Wales for the Evil One.&nbsp; Canon Silvan Evans in his Welsh
Dictionary derives this word from <i>an</i>, without, and <i>gras</i>,
grace; thus, the word becomes synonymous with gracelessness, and <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>he remarks
that, although the term is generally rendered devil, it is much softer than
that term, or its Welsh equivalent <i>diawl</i>.</p>
<p><i>Y Fall</i> is another term applied to Satan in Wales.&nbsp; Dr. Owen
Pugh defines the word as what is squabby, bulky.&nbsp; The most common
expressions for the devil, however, are <i>Cythraul</i>, and <i>diawl</i>,
or <i>diafol</i>, but these two last named words are merely forms of
Diabolos.&nbsp; Other expressions, such as Old Nick, Old Harry, have found
a home in Wales.&nbsp; <i>Y gwr drwg</i>, the bad man, <i>Gwas drwg</i>,
the wicked servant, <i>Yr yspryd drwg</i>, the wicked spirit, <i>Yr hen
fachgen</i>, the old boy, and such like expressions, are also common.&nbsp;
Silly women frighten small children by telling them that the <i>Bo</i>, the
<i>bogey</i>, the <i>bogey bo</i>, or <i>bolol</i>, etc., will take them
away if they are not quiet.</p>
<h3>Ghosts, or Spirits.</h3>
<p>Ghosts, or Spirits, were supposed to be the shades of departed human
beings who, for certain reasons, were permitted to visit either nightly, or
periodically, this upper world.</p>
<p>The hour that Spirits came to the earth was mid-night, and they remained
until cock-crowing, when they were obliged to depart.&nbsp; So strongly did
the people believe in the hours of these visits, that formerly no one would
stay from home later than twelve o&rsquo;clock at night, nor would any one
proceed on a journey, until chanticleer had announced that the way was
clear.&nbsp; Christmas Eve, however, was an exception, for during that
night, no evil Spirit could appear.</p>
<p>It was thought that if two persons were together, one only could see the
Spirit, to the other he was invisible, and to one person only would the
Spirit speak, and this he would do when addressed; otherwise, he remained
silent.</p>
<p>Ghosts re-visited the world to reveal hidden treasures, and the murdered
haunted the place where their unburied <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>bodies lay, or until
vengeance overtook the murderer, and the wicked were doomed to walk the
earth until they were laid in lake, or river, or in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The presence of Spirits was announced by a clanking of chains, by
shrieks, or other horrible noises, and dogs, and horses, were credited with
the power of seeing Spirits.&nbsp; Horses trembled and perspired at their
presence, and dogs whined and crouched at their approach.</p>
<p>The tales which I shall now relate throw a glimmering light on the
subject now under consideration.</p>
<h3>The Gloddaeth Ghost.</h3>
<p>The following tale was told the Rev. Owen Jones, Pentrevoelas, by Thomas
Davies, Tycoch, Rhyl, the hero in the story.</p>
<p>I may say that Gloddaeth Wood is a remnant of the prim&aelig;val forest
that is mentioned by Sir John Wynn, in his <i>History of the Gwydir
Family</i>, as extending over a large tract of the country.&nbsp; This
wood, being undisturbed and in its original wild condition, was the home of
foxes and other vermin, for whose destruction the surrounding parishes
willingly paid half-a-crown per head.&nbsp; This reward was an inducement
to men who had leisure, to trap and hunt these obnoxious animals.&nbsp;
Thomas Davies was engaged in this work, and, taking a walk through the wood
one day for the purpose of discovering traces of foxes, he came upon a
fox&rsquo;s den, and from the marks about the burrow he ascertained that
there were young foxes in the hole.&nbsp; This was to him a grand
discovery, for, in anticipation, cubs and vixen were already his.&nbsp;
Looking about him, he noticed that there was opposite the fox&rsquo;s den a
large oak tree with forked branches, and this sight settled his plan of
operation.&nbsp; He saw that he could place himself in this tree in such a
position that he could see the vixen leave, and return to her den, and,
from his knowledge of the habits of the animal, he knew <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>she would commence
foraging when darkness and stillness prevailed.&nbsp; He therefore
determined to commence the campaign forthwith, and so he went home to make
his preparations.</p>
<p>I should say that the sea was close to the wood, and that small craft
often came to grief on the coast.&nbsp; I will now proceed with the
story.</p>
<p>Davies had taken his seat on a bough opposite the fox&rsquo;s den, when
he heard a horrible scream in the direction of the sea, which apparently
was that of a man in distress, and the sound uttered was &ldquo;Oh,
Oh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Davies&rsquo;s attention was divided between the
dismal, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and his fox.&nbsp; But, as the sound was a far
way off, he felt disinclined to heed it, for he did not think it incumbent
on him to ascertain the cause of that distressing utterance, nor did he
think it his duty to go to the relief of a suffering fellow creature.&nbsp;
He therefore did not leave his seat on the tree.&nbsp; But the cry of
anguish, every now and again, reached his ears, and evidently, it was
approaching the tree on which Davies sat.&nbsp; He now listened the more to
the awful sounds, which at intervals reverberated through the wood, and he
could no longer be mistaken&mdash;they were coming in his direction.&nbsp;
Nearer and nearer came the dismal &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; and with its
approach, the night became pitch dark, and now the &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; was only a few yards off, but nothing could be seen in
consequence of the deep darkness.&nbsp; The sounds however ceased, but a
horrible sight was presented to the frightened man&rsquo;s view.&nbsp;
There, he saw before him, a nude being with eyes burning like fire, and
these glittering balls were directed towards him.&nbsp; The awful being was
only a dozen yards or so off.&nbsp; And now it crouched, and now it stood
erect, but it never for a single instant withdrew its terrible eyes from
the miserable man in the tree, who would <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>have fallen to the
ground were it not for the protecting boughs.&nbsp; Many times Davies
thought that his last moment had come, for it seemed that the owner of
those fiery eyes was about to spring upon him.&nbsp; As he did not do so,
Davies somewhat regained his self possession, and thought of firing at the
horrible being; but his courage failed, and there he sat motionless, not
knowing what the end might be.&nbsp; He closed his eyes to avoid that gaze,
which seemed to burn into him, but this was a short relief, for he felt
constrained to look into those burning orbs, still it was a relief even to
close his eyes: and so again and again he closed them, only, however, to
open them on those balls of fire.&nbsp; About 4 o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, he heard a cock crow at Penbryn farm, and at the moment his eyes
were closed, but at the welcome sound he opened them, and looked for those
balls of fire, but, oh! what pleasure, they were no longer before him, for,
at the crowing of the cock, they, and the being to whom they belonged, had
disappeared.</p>
<h3>Tymawr Ghost, Bryneglwys.</h3>
<p>This Ghost plagued the servants, pinched and tormented them, and they
could not get rest day nor night; such was the character of this Ghost as
told me by Mr. Richard Jones, Ty&rsquo;n-y-wern.&nbsp; But, said I, what
was the cause of his acts, was it the Ghost of anyone who had been
murdered?&nbsp; To this question, Jones gave the following account of the
Ghost&rsquo;s arrival at Tymawr.&nbsp; A man called at this farm, and
begged for something to eat, and as he was shabbily dressed, the girls
laughed at him, and would not give him anything, and when going away, he
said, speaking over his shoulder, &ldquo;You will repent your conduct to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a few nights afterwards the house was plagued, and the
servants were pinched all night.&nbsp; This went on days and days, until
the <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>people were tired of their lives.&nbsp; They, however, went to
Griffiths, Llanarmon, a minister, who was celebrated as a Layer of Ghosts,
and he came, and succeeded in capturing the Ghost in the form of a spider,
and shut him up in his tobacco box and carried him away, and the servants
were never afterwards plagued.</p>
<h3>Ffrith Farm Ghost.</h3>
<p>I am indebted to Mr. Williams, schoolmaster, Bryneglwys, for the history
of this Ghost.</p>
<p>It was not known why Ffrith farm was troubled by a Ghost; but when the
servants were busily engaged in cheese making the Spirit would suddenly
throw mortar, or filthy matter, into the milk, and thus spoil the
curds.&nbsp; The dairy was visited by the Ghost, and there he played havoc
with the milk and dishes.&nbsp; He sent the pans, one after the other,
around the room, and dashed them to pieces.&nbsp; The terrible doings of
the Ghost was a topic of general conversation in those parts.&nbsp; The
farmer offered a reward of five pounds to anyone who would lay the
Spirit.&nbsp; One Sunday afternoon, about 2 o&rsquo;clock, an aged priest
visited the farm yard, and in the presence of a crowd of spectators
exorcised the Ghost, but without effect.&nbsp; In fact, the Ghost waved a
woman&rsquo;s bonnet right in the face of the priest.&nbsp; The farmer then
sent for Griffiths, an Independent minister at Llanarmon, who enticed the
Ghost to the barn.&nbsp; Here the Ghost appeared in the form of a lion, but
he could not touch Griffiths, because he stood in the centre of a circle,
which the lion could not pass over.&nbsp; Griffiths persuaded the Ghost to
appear in a less formidable shape, or otherwise he would have nothing to do
with him.&nbsp; The Ghost next came in the form of a mastiff, but Griffiths
objected even to this appearance; at last, the Ghost appeared as a fly,
which was captured by Griffiths and secured in his tobacco box, and <!--
page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>carried
away.&nbsp; Griffiths acknowledged that this Ghost was the most formidable
one that he had ever conquered.</p>
<p>From this tale it would appear that some ghosts were more easily
overcome than others.</p>
<h3>Pont-y-Glyn Ghost.</h3>
<p>There is a picturesque glen between Corwen and Cerrig-y-Drudion, down
which rushes a mountain stream, and over this stream is a bridge, called
Pont-y-Glyn.&nbsp; On the left hand side, a few yards from the bridge, on
the Corwen side, is a yawning chasm, through which the river bounds.&nbsp;
Here people who have travelled by night affirm that they have seen
ghosts&mdash;the ghosts of those who have been murdered in this secluded
glen.</p>
<p>A man who is now a bailiff near Ruthin, but at the time of the
appearance of the Ghost to him at Pont-y-Glyn was a servant at Garth
Meilio&mdash;states that one night, when he was returning home late from
Corwen, he saw before him, seated on a heap of stones, a female dressed in
Welsh costume.&nbsp; He wished her good night, but she returned him no
answer.&nbsp; She, however, got up and proceeded down the road, which she
filled, so great were her increased dimensions.</p>
<p>Other Spirits are said to have made their homes in the hills not far
from Pont-y-Glyn.&nbsp; There was the Spirit of Ystrad Fawr, a strange
Ghost that transformed himself into many things.&nbsp; I will give the
description of this Ghost in the words of the author of <i>Y
Gordofigion</i>.</p>
<h3>Ysbryd Ystrad Fawr.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Yr oedd Ysbryd yn Ystrad Fawr, ger Llangwm, yn arfer ymddangos ar
brydiau ar lun twrci, a&rsquo;i gynffon o&rsquo;i amgylch fel olwyn
troell.&nbsp; Bryd arall, byddai yn y coed, nes y byddai y rhai hyny yn
ymddangos fel pe buasent oll ar d&acirc;n; bryd <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>arall, byddai fel ci
du mawr yn cnoi asgwrn.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Y Gordofigion</i>, p. 106.</p>
<p><i>Ystrad Fawr Ghost</i> in English is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was a Ghost at Ystrad Fawr, near Llangwm, that was in the habit of
appearing like a turkey with his tail spread out like a spinning
wheel.&nbsp; At other times he appeared in the wood, when the trees would
seem as if they were on fire, again he would assume the shape of a large
black dog gnawing a bone.</p>
<h3>Ty Felin Ghost, Llanynys.</h3>
<p>An exciseman, overtaken by night, went to a house called Ty Felin, in
the parish of Llanynys, and asked for lodgings.&nbsp; Unfortunately the
house was a very small one, containing only two bedrooms, and one of these
was haunted, consequently no one dared sleep in it.&nbsp; After awhile,
however, the stranger induced the master to allow him to sleep in this
haunted room; he had not been there long before a Ghost entered the room in
the shape of a travelling Jew, and the Spirit walked around the room.&nbsp;
The exciseman tried to catch him, and gave chase, but he lost sight of the
Jew in the yard.&nbsp; He had scarcely entered the room, a second time,
when he again saw the Ghost.&nbsp; He again chased him, and lost sight of
him in the same place.&nbsp; The third time he followed the Ghost, he made
a mark on the yard, where the Ghost vanished and went to rest, and was not
again troubled.&nbsp; He got up early and went his way, but, before long,
he returned to Ty Felin accompanied by a policeman, whom he requested to
dig in the place where his mark was.&nbsp; This was done, and, underneath a
superficial covering, a deep well was discovered, and in it a corpse.&nbsp;
On examining the tenant of the house, he confessed that a travelling Jew,
selling jewelry, etc., once lodged with him, and that he had murdered him,
and cast his body in the well.</p>
<h3><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span><i>Llandegla Spirit</i>.</h3>
<p>The tale of this Spirit was given me by Mr. Roberts, late Schoolmaster
of Llandegla.&nbsp; A small river runs close to the secluded village of
Llandegla, and in this mountain stream under a huge stone lies a wicked
Ghost.&nbsp; The tale is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The old Rectory at Llandegla was haunted; the Spirit was very
troublesome; no peace was to be got because of it; every night it was at
its work.&nbsp; A person of the name of Griffiths, who lived at Graianrhyd,
was sent for to lay the Ghost.&nbsp; He came to the Rectory, but the Spirit
could not be overcome.&nbsp; It is true Griffiths saw it, but in such a
form that he could not approach it; night after night, the Spirit appeared
in various forms, but still the conjurer was unable to master it.&nbsp; At
last it came to the wise man in the form of a fly, which Griffiths
immediately captured, and placed in a small box.&nbsp; This box he buried
under a large stone in the river, just below the bridge, near the Llandegla
Mills, and there the Spirit is to remain until a certain tree, which grows
by the bridge, reaches the height of the parapet, and then, when this takes
place, the Spirit shall have power to regain his liberty.&nbsp; To prevent
this tree from growing, the school children, even to this day, nip the
upper branches, and thus retard its upward growth.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts
received the story I have given, from the old Parish Clerk, John Jones the
weaver, who died a few years ago.</p>
<h3>Lady Jeffrey&rsquo;s Spirit.</h3>
<p>This lady could not rest in her grave because of her misdeeds, and she
troubled people dreadfully; at last she was persuaded or enticed to
contract her dimensions, and enter into a bottle.&nbsp; She did so, after
appearing in a good many hideous forms; but when she got into the bottle,
it was corked down securely, and the bottle was cast into the pool <!--
page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>underneath the Short bridge, Llanidloes, and there the lady was
to remain until the ivy that grew up the buttresses should overgrow the
sides of the bridge, and reach the parapet.&nbsp; The ivy was dangerously
near the top of the bridge when the writer was a schoolboy, and often did
he and his companions crop off its tendrils as they neared the prescribed
limits for we were all terribly afraid to release the dreaded lady out of
the bottle.&nbsp; In the year 1848, the old bridge was blown up, and a new
one built instead of it.&nbsp; A schoolfellow, whom we called Ben, was
playing by the aforesaid pool when the bridge was undergoing
reconstruction, and he found by the river&rsquo;s side a small bottle, and
in the bottle was a little black thing, that was never quiet, but it kept
bobbing up and down continually, just as if it wanted to get out.&nbsp; Ben
kept the bottle safely for a while, but ere long he was obliged to throw it
into the river, for his relations and neighbours came to the conclusion
that that was the very bottle that contained Lady Jeffrey&rsquo;s Spirit,
and they also surmised that the little black restless thing was nothing
less than the lady herself.&nbsp; Ben consequently resigned the bottle and
its contents to the pool again, there to undergo a prolonged, but unjust,
term of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Pentrevoelas.&mdash;Squire Griffith&rsquo;s Ghost.</h3>
<p>A couple of workmen engaged at Foelas, the seat of the late Squire
Griffiths, thought they would steal a few apples from the orchard for their
children, and for this purpose one evening, just before leaving off work,
they climbed up a tree, but happening to look down, whom should they see
but the Squire, wearing his three-cornered hat, and dressed in the clothes
he used to wear when alive, and he was leaning against the trunk of the
tree on which they were perched.&nbsp; In great fright they dropped to the
ground and took to their heels.&nbsp; They ran without stopping <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>to Bryn
Coch, but there, to their horror, stood the Squire in the middle of the
road quietly leaning on his staff.&nbsp; They again avoided him and ran
home every step, without looking behind them.&nbsp; The orchard robbers
never again saw their late master, nor did they ever again attempt to rob
the orchard.</p>
<h3>David Salisbury&rsquo;s Ghost.</h3>
<p>I will quote from <i>Bye-Gones</i>, vol. iii., p. 211, an account of
this Spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There was an old Welsh tradition in vogue some fifty years ago,
that one David Salisbury, son of <i>Harri Goch</i> of Llanrhaiadr, near
Denbigh, and grandson to Thomas Salisbury h&ecirc;n of Lleweni, had given
considerable trouble to the living, long after his remains had been laid in
the grave.&nbsp; A good old soul, Mr. Griffiths of Llandegla, averred that
he had seen his ghost, mounted upon a white horse, galloping over hedges
and ditches in the dead of night, and had heard his &lsquo;terrible
groans,&rsquo; which, he concluded, proceeded from the weight of sin
troubling the unhappy soul, which had to undergo these untimely and
unpleasant antics.&nbsp; An old Welsh ballad entitled &lsquo;Ysbryd Dafydd
Salbri,&rsquo; professed to give the true account of the individual in
question, but the careful search of many years has failed me in securing a
copy of that horrible song.</p>
<p>GORONWY IFAN.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Spirit fared better than most of his compeers, for they, poor
things, were, according to the popular voice, often doomed to ride headless
horses, which madly galloped, the livelong night, hither and thither, where
they would, to the great terror of the midnight traveller who might meet
this mad unmanageable creature, and also, as it would seem, to the
additional discomfort of the unfortunate rider.</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>It is, or was believed in Gyffylliog parish, which is in the
recesses of the Denbighshire mountains, four or five miles to the west of
Ruthin, that the horses ridden by Spirits and goblins were real horses, and
it was there said when horses were found in their stables at dawn in a
state of perspiration that they had been taken out in the night and ridden
by Spirits about the country, and hence their jaded condition in the
morning.</p>
<p>It was also thought that the horses found in the morning in their
pasture ground with tangled manes and tails, and bodies covered with mud,
had been during the night used by Spirits, who rushed them through mire and
brier, and that consequently they presented the appearance of animals who
had followed the hounds in a long chase through a stiff country.</p>
<p>There is a strong family likeness between all Ghost stories, and a lack
of originality in their construction, but this suggests a common source
from which the majority of these fictions are derived.</p>
<p>I now come to another phase of Spirit Folk-Lore, which has already been
alluded to, viz., the visits of Ghosts for the purpose of revealing hidden
treasures.&nbsp; The following tale, which I took down from the mouth of
John Rowland, at one time the tenant of Plas-yn-llan, Efenechtyd, is an
instance of this kind of story.</p>
<h3>A Ghost Appearing to point out Hidden Treasures.</h3>
<p>There is a farm house called Clwchdyrnog in the parish of Llanddeusant,
Anglesey, which was said to have been haunted by a Spirit.&nbsp; It seems
that no one would summon courage to speak to the Ghost, though it was seen
by several parties; but one night, John Hughes, Bodedern, a widower, who
visited the house for the purpose of obtaining <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>a second Mrs. Hughes
from among the servant girls there, spoke to the Ghost.&nbsp; The presence
of the Spirit was indicated by a great noise in the room where Hughes and
the girl were.&nbsp; In great fright Hughes invoked the Spirit, and asked
why he troubled the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I done any wrong to
you,&rdquo; said he, addressing the Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the
answer.&nbsp; Then he asked if the girl to whom he was paying his
attentions was the cause of the Spirit&rsquo;s visit, and again he received
the answer, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Hughes named individually all the
inmates of the house in succession, and inquired if they were the cause of
the Spirit&rsquo;s visits, and again he was answered in the negative.&nbsp;
Then he asked why, since no one in the house had disturbed the Spirit, he
came there to disturb the inmates.&nbsp; To this pertinent question the
Spirit answered as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;There are treasures hidden on the
south side of Ffynnon Wen, which belong to, and are to be given to, the
nine months old child in this house: when this is done, I will never
disturb this house any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spot occupied by the treasure was minutely described by the Spirit,
and Hughes promised to go to the place indicated.&nbsp; The next day, he
went to the spot, and digging into the ground, he came upon an iron chest
filled with gold, silver, and other valuables, and all these things he
faithfully delivered up to the parents of the child to be kept by them for
him until he should come of age to take possession of them himself.&nbsp;
This they faithfully did, and the Spirit never again came to the house.</p>
<p>John Rowland, my informant, was a native of Anglesey, and he stated that
all the people of Llanddeusant knew of the story which he related to
me.&nbsp; He was eighty-three years old at the time he told me the tale,
and that was in October, 1882.</p>
<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>But one of the most singular tales of the appearance of a Ghost
is recorded in the autobiography of the grandfather of the late Mr. Thomas
Wright, the well-known Shropshire antiquary.&nbsp; Mr. Wright&rsquo;s
grandfather was a Methodist, and in the early days of that body the belief
in apparitions was not uncommon amongst them.&nbsp; The story was told Mr.
Wright, sen., in 1780, at the house, in Yorkshire, of Miss Bosanquet
(afterwards the wife of Fletcher of Madeley), by Mr. John Hampson, sen., a
well-known preacher among the Methodists, who had just arrived from
Wales.</p>
<p>As the scene of the tale is laid in Powis Castle, I will call this
visitation</p>
<h3>The Powis Castle Ghost revealing a Hidden Box to a Woman.</h3>
<p>The following is the narrative:&mdash;It had been for some time reported
in the neighbourhood that a poor unmarried woman, who was a member of the
Methodist Society, and had become serious under their ministry, had seen
and conversed with the apparition of a gentleman, who had made a strange
discovery to her.&nbsp; Mr. Hampson, being desirous to ascertain if there
was any truth in the story, sent for the woman, and desired her to give him
an exact relation of the whole affair from her own mouth, and as near the
truth as she possibly could.&nbsp; She said she was a poor woman, who got
her living by spinning hemp and line; that it was customary for the farmers
and gentlemen of that neighbourhood to grow a little hemp or line in a
corner of their fields for their own home consumption, and as she was a
good hand at spinning the materials, she used to go from house to house to
inquire for work; that her method was, where they employed her, during her
stay to have meat, and drink, and lodging (if she had occasion to sleep
with them), for her work, and what they pleased to give her <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>besides.&nbsp; That, among other places, she happened to call one
day at the Welsh Earl of Powis&rsquo;s country seat, called Redcastle, to
inquire for work, as she usually had done before.&nbsp; The quality were at
this time in London, and had left the steward and his wife, with other
servants, as usual, to take care of their country residence in their
absence.&nbsp; The steward&rsquo;s wife set her to work, and in the evening
told her that she must stay all night with them, as they had more work for
her to do next day.&nbsp; When bedtime arrived, two or three of the
servants in company, with each a lighted candle in her hand, conducted her
to her lodging.&nbsp; They led her to a ground room, with a boarded floor,
and two sash windows.&nbsp; The room was grandly furnished, and had a
genteel bed in one corner of it.&nbsp; They had made her a good fire, and
had placed her a chair and a table before it, and a large lighted candle
upon the table.&nbsp; They told her that was her bedroom, and she might go
to sleep when she pleased.&nbsp; They then wished her a good night and
withdrew altogether, pulling the door quickly after them, so as to hasp the
spring-sneck in the brass lock that was upon it.&nbsp; When they were gone,
she gazed awhile at the fine furniture, under no small astonishment that
they should put such a poor person as her in so grand a room and bed, with
all the apparatus of fire, chair, table, and candle.&nbsp; She was also
surprised at the circumstance of the servants coming so many together, with
each of them a candle.&nbsp; However, after gazing about her some little
time, she sat down and took a small Welsh Bible out of her pocket, which
she always carried about with her, and in which she usually read a
chapter&mdash;chiefly in the New Testament&mdash;before she said her
prayers and went to bed.&nbsp; While she was reading she heard the room
door open, and turning her head, saw a gentleman enter in a gold-laced hat
and waistcoat, and the rest of his <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>dress corresponding
therewith.&nbsp; (I think she was very particular in describing the rest of
his dress to Mr. Hampson, and he to me at the time, but I have now forgot
the other particulars).</p>
<p>He walked down by the sash-window to the corner of the room and then
returned.&nbsp; When he came to the first window in his return (the bottom
of which was nearly breast-high), he rested his elbow on the bottom of the
window, and the side of his face upon the palm of his hand, and stood in
that leaning posture for some time, with his side partly towards her.&nbsp;
She looked at him earnestly to see if she knew him, but, though from her
frequent intercourse with them, she had a personal knowledge of all the
present family, he appeared a stranger to her.&nbsp; She supposed
afterwards that he stood in this manner to encourage her to speak; but as
she did not, after some little time he walked off, pulling the door after
him as the servants had done before.</p>
<p>She began now to be much alarmed, concluding it to be an apparition, and
that they had put her there on purpose.&nbsp; This was really the
case.&nbsp; The room, it seems, had been disturbed for a long time, so that
nobody could sleep peaceably in it, and as she passed for a very serious
woman, the servants took it into their heads to put the Methodist and
Spirit together, to see what they would make of it.</p>
<p>Startled at this thought, she rose from her chair, and kneeled down by
the bedside to say her prayers.&nbsp; While she was praying he came in
again, walked round the room, and came close behind her.&nbsp; She had it
on her mind to speak, but when she attempted it she was so very much
agitated that she could not utter a word.&nbsp; He walked out of the room
again, pulling the door after him as before.</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>She begged that God would strengthen her and not suffer her to be
tried beyond what she was able to bear.&nbsp; She recovered her spirits,
and thought she felt more confidence and resolution, and determined if he
came in again she would speak to him, if possible.</p>
<p>He presently came in again, walked round, and came behind her as before;
she turned her head and said, &ldquo;Pray, sir, who are you, and what do
you want?&rdquo;&nbsp; He put up his finger, and said, &ldquo;Take up the
candle and follow me, and I will tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She got up, took up
the candle, and followed him out of the room.&nbsp; He led her through a
long boarded passage till they came to the door of another room, which he
opened and went in.&nbsp; It was a small room, or what might be called a
large closet.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the room was small, and I believed him to be
a Spirit,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I stopped at the door; he turned and
said, &lsquo;Walk in, I will not hurt you.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I walked
in.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Observe what I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;I
will.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stooped, and tore up one of the boards of the floor,
and there appeared under it a box with an iron handle in the lid.&nbsp; He
said, &lsquo;Do you see that box?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;Yes, I
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then stepped to one side of the room, and showed me a
crevice in the wall, where, he said, a key was hid that would open
it.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;This box and key must be taken out, and sent to
the Earl in London&rsquo; (naming the Earl, and his place of residence in
the city).&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Will you see it done?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said,
&lsquo;I will do my best to get it done.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Do,
and I will trouble the house no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then walked out of
the room and left me.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He seems to have been a very civil
Spirit, and to have been very careful to affright her as little as
possible).&nbsp; &ldquo;I stepped to the room door and set up a
shout.&nbsp; The steward and his wife, and the other servants came to me
immediately, all clung together, with a number of lights in their
hands.&nbsp; It seems <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>they had all been waiting to see the issue of
the interview betwixt me and the apparition.&nbsp; They asked me what was
the matter?&nbsp; I told them the foregoing circumstances, and showed them
the box.&nbsp; The steward durst not meddle with it, but his wife had more
courage, and, with the help of the other servants, lugged it out, and found
the key.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said by their lifting it appeared to be pretty
heavy, but that she did not see it opened, and therefore did not know what
it contained; perhaps money, or writings of consequence to the family, or
both.</p>
<p>They took it away with them, and she then went to bed and slept
peaceably till the morning.</p>
<p>It appeared afterwards that they sent the box to the Earl in London,
with an account of the manner of its discovery and by whom; and the Earl
sent down orders immediately to his steward to inform the poor woman who
had been the occasion of this discovery, that if she would come and reside
in his family, she should be comfortably provided for for the remainder of
her days; or, if she did not choose to reside constantly with them, if she
would let them know when she wanted assistance, she should be liberally
supplied at his Lordship&rsquo;s expense as long as she lived.&nbsp; And
Mr. Hampson said it was a known fact in the neighbourhood that she had been
so supplied from his Lordship&rsquo;s family from the time the affair was
said to have happened, and continued to be so at the time she gave Mr.
Hampson this account.</p>
<p>Such is the tale.&nbsp; I will make no comments on it.&nbsp; Many
similar stories are extant.&nbsp; After one more tale, I will leave these
Spirit stories, and I will then relate how troublesome Ghosts were
laid.</p>
<p>The Spirits of the preceding tales were sent from the unseen world to do
good, but the Spirit of the maiden who gives a name to a Welsh lake, cried
out for vengeance; but <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>history does not inform us that she obtained
satisfaction.&nbsp; There is a lake in Carnarvonshire called
<i>Llyn-N&acirc;d-y-Forwyn</i>, or the Lake of the Maiden&rsquo;s Cry, to
which is attached the following tale.&nbsp; I will call the tale</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Llyn-N&acirc;d-y-Forwyn.</h3>
<p>It is said that a young man was about to marry a young girl, and on the
evening before the wedding they were rambling along the water&rsquo;s side
together, but the man was false, and loved another better than the woman
whom he was about to wed.&nbsp; They were alone in an unfrequented country,
and the deceiver pushed the girl into the lake to get rid of her to marry
his sweetheart.&nbsp; She lost her life.&nbsp; But ever afterwards her
Spirit troubled the neighbourhood, but chiefly the scene of her
murder.&nbsp; Sometimes she appeared as a ball of fire, rolling along the
river Colwyn, at other times she appeared as a lady dressed in silk, taking
a solitary walk along the banks of the river.&nbsp; At other times, groans
and shrieks were heard coming out of the river&mdash;just such screams as
would be uttered by a person who was being murdered.&nbsp; Sometimes a
young maiden was seen emerging out of the waters, half naked, with
dishevelled hair, that covered her shoulders, and the country resounded
with her heart-rending crying as she appeared in the lake.&nbsp; The
frequent crying of the Spirit gave to the lake its name,
Llyn-N&acirc;d-y-Forwyn.</p>
<h3>Spirit Laying.</h3>
<p>It must have been a consolation to those who believed in the power of
wicked Spirits to trouble people, that it was possible to lay these evil
visitors in a pool of water, or to drive them away to the Red Sea, or to
some other distant part of the world.&nbsp; It was generally thought that
Spirits could be laid by a priest; and there were particular forms of
exorcising these troublesome beings.&nbsp; A conjuror, or <i>Dyn
Hysbys</i>, was also credited with this power, and it was <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>thought that
the prayer of a righteous man could overcome these emissaries of evil.</p>
<p>But there was a place for hope in the case of these transported or laid
Spirits.&nbsp; It was granted to some to return from the Red Sea to the
place whence they departed by the length of a grain of wheat or barley corn
yearly.&nbsp; The untold ages that it would take to accomplish a journey of
four thousand miles thus slowly was but a very secondary consideration to
the annihilation of hope.&nbsp; Many were the conditions imposed upon the
vanquished Spirits by their conquerors before they could be permitted to
return to their old haunts, and well might it be said that the conditions
could not possibly be carried out; but still there was a place for hope in
the breast of the doomed by the imposition of any terminable
punishment.</p>
<p>The most ancient instance of driving out a Spirit that I am acquainted
with is to be found in the Book of Tobit.&nbsp; It seems to be the
prototype of many like tales.&nbsp; The angel Raphael and Tobias were by
the river Tigris, when a fish jumped out of the river, which by the
direction of the angel was seized by the young man, and its heart, and
liver, and gall extracted, and, at the angel&rsquo;s command carefully
preserved by Tobias.&nbsp; When asked what their use might be, the angel
informed him that the smoke of the heart and liver would drive away a devil
or Evil Spirit that troubled anyone.&nbsp; In the 14th verse of the sixth
chapter of Tobit we are told that a devil loved Sara, but that he did no
harm to anyone, excepting to those who came near her.&nbsp; Knowing this,
the young man was afraid to marry the woman; but remembering the words of
Raphael, he went in unto his wife, and took the ashes of the perfumes as
ordered, and put the heart and liver of the fish thereupon, and made a
smoke therewith, the which smell, when the Evil Spirit had <!-- page
211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>smelled, he
fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.&nbsp; Such is
the story, many variants of which are found in many countries.</p>
<p>I am grieved to find that Sir John Wynne, who wrote the interesting and
valuable <i>History of the Gwydir Family</i>, which ought to have secured
for him kindly recognition from his countrymen, was by them deposited after
death, for troubling good people, in Rhaiadr y Wenol.&nbsp; The
superstition has found a place in Yorke&rsquo;s <i>Royal Tribes of
Wales</i>.</p>
<p>The following quotation is from the <i>History of the Gwydir Family</i>,
Oswestry Edition, p. 7:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being shrewd and successful in his dealings, people were led to
believe he oppressed them,&rdquo; and says Yorke in his <i>Royal Tribes of
Wales</i>, &ldquo;It is the superstition of Llanrwst to this day that the
Spirit of the old gentleman lies under the great waterfall, Rhaiadr y
Wennol, there to be punished, purged, spouted upon and purified from the
foul deeds done in his days of nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gentleman, though, is not alone in occupying, until his misdeeds
are expiated, a watery grave.&nbsp; There is hardly a pool in a river, or
lake in which Spirits have not, according to popular opinion, been
laid.&nbsp; In our days though, it is only the aged that speak of such
matters.</p>
<p>A Spirit could in part be laid.&nbsp; It is said that Abel Owen&rsquo;s
Spirit, of Henblas, was laid by Gruffydd Jones, Cilhaul, in a bottle, and
buried in a <i>gors</i> near Llanrwst.</p>
<p>This Gruffydd Jones had great trouble at Hafod Ucha between Llanrwst and
Conway, to lay a Spirit.&nbsp; He began in the afternoon, and worked hard
the whole night and the next day to lay the Spirit, but he succeeded in
overcoming a part only of the Spirit.&nbsp; He was nearly dead from
exhaustion and want of food before he could even master a portion of the
Spirit.</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>The preceding is a singular tale, for it teaches that Spirits are
divisible.&nbsp; A portion of this Spirit, repute says, is still at large,
whilst a part is undergoing purification.</p>
<p>The following tale was told me by my friend, the Rev. T. H. Evans, Vicar
of Llanwddyn.</p>
<h3>Cynon&rsquo;s Ghost.</h3>
<p>One of the wicked Spirits which plagued the secluded Valley of Llanwddyn
long before it was converted into a vast reservoir to supply Liverpool with
water was that of <i>Cynon</i>.&nbsp; Of this Spirit Mr. Evans writes
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Yspryd Cynon</i> was a mischievous goblin, which was
put down by <i>Dic Spot</i> and put in a quill, and placed under a large
stone in the river below Cynon Isaf.&nbsp; The stone is called
&lsquo;<i>Careg yr Yspryd</i>,&rsquo; the Ghost Stone.&nbsp; This one
received the following instructions, that he was to remain under the stone
until the water should work its way between the stone and the dry
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor Spirit, to all appearance, was doomed to a very long
imprisonment, but <i>Dic Spot</i> did not foresee the wants and enterprise
of the people of Liverpool, who would one day convert the Llanwddyn Valley
into a lake fifteen miles in circumference, and release the Spirit from
prison by the process of making their Waterworks.</p>
<p>I might here say that there is another version current in the parish
besides that given me by Mr. Evans, which is that the Spirit was to remain
under the stone until the river was dried up.&nbsp; Perhaps both conditions
were, to make things safe, imposed upon the Spirit.</p>
<p><i>Careg yr Yspryd</i> and Cynon Isaf were at the entrance to the Valley
of Llanwddyn, and down this opening, or mouth of the valley, rushed the
river&mdash;the river that was to be dammed up for the use of
Liverpool.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the valley knew the tradition
respecting the Spirit, and they <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>much feared its being disturbed.&nbsp; The
stone was a large boulder, from fifteen to twenty tons in weight, and it
was evident that it was doomed to destruction, for it stood in the river
Vyrnwy just where operations were to commence.&nbsp; There was no small
stir among the Welsh inhabitants when preparations were made to blast the
huge Spirit-stone.&nbsp; English and Irish workmen could not enter into the
feeling of the Welsh towards this stone, but they had heard what was said
about it.&nbsp; They, however, had no dread of the imprisoned Spirit.&nbsp;
In course of time the stone was bored and a load of dynamite inserted, but
it was not shattered at the first blast.&nbsp; About four feet square
remained intact, and underneath this the Spirit was, if it was
anywhere.&nbsp; The men were soon set to work to demolish the stone.&nbsp;
The Welshmen expected some catastrophe to follow its destruction, and they
were even prepared to see the Spirit bodily emerge from its prison, for,
said they, the conditions of its release have been fulfilled&mdash;the
river had been diverted from its old bed into an artificial channel, to
facilitate the removal of this and other stones&mdash;and there was no
doubt that both conditions had been literally carried out, and consequently
the Spirit, if justice ruled, could claim its release.&nbsp; The stone was
blasted, and strange to relate, when the smoke had cleared away, the water
in a cavity where the stone had been was seen to move; there was no
apparent reason why the water should thus be disturbed, unless, indeed, the
Spirit was about to appear.&nbsp; The Welsh workmen became alarmed, and
moved away from the place, keeping, however, their eyes fixed on the
pool.&nbsp; The mystery was soon solved, for a large frog made its
appearance, and, sedately sitting on a fragment of the shattered stone,
rubbed its eyes with its feet, as if awaking from a long sleep.&nbsp; The
question was discussed, &ldquo;Is it a frog, or the Spirit in <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>the form of
a frog; if it is a frog, why was it not killed when the stone was
blasted?&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;Who ever saw a frog sit up in that
fashion and rub the dust out of its eyes?&nbsp; It must be the
Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; There the workmen stood, at a respectful distance from
the frog, who, heedless of the marked attention paid to it, continued
sitting up and rubbing its eyes.&nbsp; They would not approach it, for it
must be the Spirit, and no one knew what its next movement or form might
be.&nbsp; At last, however, the frog was driven away, and the men
re-commenced their labours.&nbsp; But for nights afterwards people passing
the spot heard a noise as of heavy chains being dragged along the ground
where the stone once stood.</p>
<h3>Caellwyngrydd Spirit.</h3>
<p>This was a dangerous Spirit.&nbsp; People passing along the road were
stoned by it; its work was always mischievous and hurtful.&nbsp; At last it
was exorcised and sent far away to the Red Sea, but it was permitted to
return the length of a barley corn every year towards its lost home.</p>
<p>From the tales already given, it is seen that the people believed in the
possibility of getting rid of troublesome Spirits, and the person whose aid
was sought on these occasions was often a minister of religion.&nbsp; We
have seen how Griffiths of Llanarmon had reached notoriety in this
direction, and he lived in quite modern times.&nbsp; The clergy were often
consulted in matters of this kind, and they were commonly believed to have
power over Spirits.&nbsp; The Rev. Walter Davies had great credit as a
Spirit layer, and he lived far into the present century.&nbsp; Going
further back, I find that Archdeacon Edmund Prys, and his contemporary and
friend, Huw Llwyd, were famous opponents of Evil Spirits, and their
services are said to have been highly appreciated, because always
successful.&nbsp; The manner <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>of laying Spirits differed.&nbsp; In this
century, prayer and Bible reading were usually resorted to, but in other
days, incantation was employed.&nbsp; We have seen how Griffiths surrounded
himself with an enchanted circle, which the Spirit could not break
through.&nbsp; This ring was thought to be impervious to the Ghost tribe,
and therefore it was the protection of the person whom it surrounded.&nbsp;
The Spirit was invoked and commanded to depart by the person within the
magic ring and it obeyed the mandate.&nbsp; Sometimes it was found
necessary to conduct a service in Church, in Latin by night, the Church
being lit up with consecrated candles, ere the Ghost could be overcome.</p>
<p>When Spirits were being laid, we are told that they presented themselves
in various forms to the person engaged in laying them, and that ultimately
they foolishly came transformed into some innocuous insect or animal, which
he was able to overcome.&nbsp; The simplicity of the Ghosts is ridiculous,
and can only be understood by supposing that the various steps in the
contest for the mastery are not forthcoming, that they have been lost.</p>
<p>These various metamorphoses would imply that transmigration was believed
in by our forefathers.</p>
<h3>Ghost Raising.</h3>
<p>If the possibility of Ghost Laying was believed in, so also was the
possibility of raising Evil Spirits.&nbsp; This faith dates from olden
times.&nbsp; Shakespeare, to this, as to most other popular notions, has
given a place in his immortal plays.&nbsp; Speaking rightly in the name of
&ldquo;Glendower,&rdquo; a Welshman, conversant with Ghosts and Goblins,
the poet makes him say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can call Spirits from the vasty deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Henry the Fourth</i>, Act III., S. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>And again in the same person&rsquo;s mouth are placed these
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I can teach you, cousin, <i>to command the
devil</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The witches in Macbeth have this power ascribed to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll catch it ere it come to ground:<br />
And that, distilled by magic sleights,<br />
<i>Shall raise such artificial Sprites</i>,<br />
<i>As by the strength of their illusion</i><br />
Shall draw him on to his confusion.</p>
<p><i>Macbeth</i>, Act III., S. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea has continued right to our own days, and adepts in the black
art have affirmed that they possess this power.</p>
<p>Doctor Bennion, a gentleman well known in his lifetime in and about
Oswestry, was thought to be able to raise Devils.&nbsp; I find in the
history of <i>Ffynnon Elian</i>, p. 12, that the doctor visited John Evans,
the last custodian of the well, and taught him how to accomplish this
feat.&nbsp; For the benefit of those anxious to obtain this power, I will
give the doctor&rsquo;s recipe:&mdash;&ldquo;Publish it abroad that you can
raise the Devil, and the country will believe you, and will credit you with
many miracles.&nbsp; All that you have to do afterwards is to be silent,
and you will then be as good a raiser of Devils as I am, and I as good as
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evans confesses that he acted according to the astute doctor&rsquo;s
advice, and he adds&mdash;&ldquo;The people in a very short time spoke much
about me, and they soon came to intrust everything to me, their conduct
frightened me, for they looked upon me as if I were a god.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This man died August 14th, 1858.</p>
<h3>Witches and Conjurors.</h3>
<p>From and before the days of King Saul, to the present moment, witches
have held dreaded sway over the affairs of man.&nbsp; Cruel laws have been
promulgated against them, they have been murdered by credulous and
infuriated mobs, <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>they have lost their lives after legal trial,
but still, witches have lived on through the dark days of ignorance, and
even in these days of light and learning they have their votaries.&nbsp;
There must be something in the human constitution peculiarly adapted to the
exercise of witchcraft, or it could not have lived so long, nor could it
have been so universal, as it undoubtedly is, unless men lent themselves
willingly to its impositions.</p>
<p>It is curious to notice how good and enlightened men have clung to a
belief in witchcraft.&nbsp; It is, consequently, not to be wondered at that
the common people placed faith in witches and conjurors when their
superiors in learning professed a like faith.</p>
<p>I have often spoken to intelligent men, who did not scruple to confess
that they believed in witches and conjurors, and they adduced instances to
prove that their faith had a foundation in fact.</p>
<p>Almost up to our days, the farmer who lost anything valuable consulted a
conjuror, and vowed vengeance on the culprit if it were not restored by
such and such a time, and invariably the stolen property was returned to
its owner before the specified period had expired.&nbsp; As detectives, the
conjurors, therefore, occupied a well-defined and useful place in rural
morality, and witches, too, were indirectly teachers of charity, for no
farm wife would refuse refreshments to the destitute lest vengeance should
overtake her.&nbsp; In this way the deserving beggar obtained needed
assistance from motives of self-preservation from benefactors whose fears
made them charitable.</p>
<p>But, if these benefits were derived from a false faith, the evils
attending that faith were nevertheless most disastrous to the community at
large, and many inhuman Acts were passed in various reigns to eradicate
witchcraft.&nbsp; From the <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>wording of these Acts it will be seen what
witches were credited with doing.</p>
<p>An Act passed 33 Henry VIII. adjudged all witchcraft and sorcery to be
felony.&nbsp; A like Act was passed 1 James, c.12, and also in the reign of
Philip and Mary.&nbsp; The following is an extract:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All persons who shall practise invocation, or conjuration, of
wicked spirits, any witchcraft, enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby any
person shall happen to be killed, or destroyed, shall, with their aiders,
and abettors, be accounted felons, without benefit of clergy; and all
persons practising any witchcraft, etc., whereby any person shall happen to
be wasted, consumed, or lamed in his or her body, or members, or whereby
any goods, or chattels, shall be destroyed, wasted, or impaired, shall,
with their counsellors, and aiders, suffer for the first offence one
year&rsquo;s imprisonment and the pillory, and for the second the
punishment of felony without the clergy.&rdquo;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;If
any person shall consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed, or reward
any evil or wicked spirit, or <i>take up any dead man</i>, <i>woman</i>,
<i>or child out of his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>or their grave</i>; or, the
skin, bone, or any other part of any dead person to be employed in any
manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment, etc., <i>he shall
suffer death as a felon</i>, without benefit of clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The law of James I. was repealed in George II.&rsquo;s. reign, but even
then persons pretending to use witchcraft, tell fortunes, or discover
stolen goods, by skill in the occult sciences, were to be punished by a
year&rsquo;s imprisonment; and by an Act, 5 George IV., c.83, any person or
persons using any subtle art, means, or device, by palmistry, or otherwise,
to deceive his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, were to be deemed rogues and
vagabonds, and to be punished with imprisonment and hard labour.</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>Acts of Parliament did not succeed in eradicating
witchcraft.&nbsp; Its power has waned, but it still exercises an influence,
shadowy though it be, on certain minds, though in its grosser forms it has
disappeared.</p>
<p>Formerly, ailments of all kinds, and misfortunes of every description,
were ascribed to the malignant influence of some old decrepit female, and
it was believed that nature&rsquo;s laws could be changed by these witches,
that they could at will produce tempests to destroy the produce of the
earth, and strike with sickness those who had incurred their
displeasure.&nbsp; Thus Lady Macbeth, speaking of these hags,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.&nbsp; When I burned in desire to question them
further they made themselves air, into which they vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Macbeth</i>, Act. i, S. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The uncanny knowledge possessed by witches was used, it was thought, to
injure people, and their malice towards good, hard-working, honest folk was
unmistakable.&nbsp; They afflicted children from sheer love of cruelty, and
bewitched animals gratuitously, or for slights which they supposed their
owners had shown towards them; consequently their knowledge was considered
to be greatly inimical to others, and particularly baneful to the
industrious, whom witches hated.</p>
<p>There was hardly a district that had not its witches.&nbsp; Children ran
away when they saw approaching them an aged woman, with a red shawl on, for
they believed she was a witch, who could, with her evil eye, injure
them.&nbsp; It was, however, believed that the machinations of witches
could be counteracted in various ways, and by and by some of these charms
shall be given.&nbsp; Life would have been intolerable but for these
antidotes to witchcraft.</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Shakespeare&rsquo;s knowledge of Welsh Folk-lore was extensive
and peculiarly faithful, and what he says of witches in general agrees with
the popular opinion respecting them in Wales.&nbsp; I cannot do better than
quote from this great Folk-lorist a few things that he tells us about
witches.</p>
<p>Mention has been made of witches taking dead bodies out of their graves
to make use of them in their enchantments, and Shakespeare, in his
description of the witches&rsquo; cauldron, shows that they threw into the
seething pot many portions of human beings.&nbsp; The first witch in
<i>Macbeth</i> says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Round about the cauldron go,<br />
In the poisoned <i>entrails</i> throw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third witch mentions other things that are thrown into the pot,
as:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,<br />
Witches&rsquo; mummy, maw and gulf<br />
Of the ravin&rsquo;d salt-sea shark,<br />
Root of hemlock digged i&rsquo; the dark,<br />
<i>Liver of blaspheming Jew</i>,<br />
Gall of goat, and slips of yew<br />
Sliver&rsquo;d in the moon&rsquo;s eclipse,<br />
<i>Nose of Turk</i>, <i>and Tartar&rsquo;s lips</i>,<br />
Finger of birth-strangled babe<br />
Ditch-delivered by a drab.</p>
<p><i>Macbeth</i>, A. IV., S. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was thought that witches could change themselves, and other people,
into the form of animals.&nbsp; In Wales, the cat and the hare were the
favourite animals into which witches transformed themselves, but they did
not necessarily confine themselves to these animals.&nbsp; They were able
to travel in the air on a broom-stick; make children ill; give maids the
nightmare; curse with madness, animals; bring misfortune on families;
hinder the dairy maid from making <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>butter; and many more
imaginary things were placed to their credit.</p>
<p>The personal appearance of witches, as given by Shakespeare, corresponds
exactly with the Welsh idea of these hags.&nbsp; On this subject the poet
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  What are these<br />
<i>So wither&rsquo;d and so wild in their attire</i><br />
That look not like the inhabitants o&rsquo; the earth,<br />
And yet are on&rsquo;t?&mdash;Live you?&nbsp; Or are you aught<br />
That man may question?&nbsp; You seem to understand me,<br />
By each at once her chappy fingers laying<br />
Upon her skinny lips:&mdash;you should be women,<br />
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret<br />
That you are so.</p>
<p><i>Macbeth</i>, Act I., S. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A striking and pathetic portrait of a witch, taken from <i>Otway&rsquo;s
Orphan</i>, Act. II., is given in No. 117 of the <i>Spectator</i>.&nbsp; It
is so true to life and apposite to our subject that I will quote
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a close lane, as I pursu&rsquo;d my journey,<br />
I spy&rsquo;d a wrinkled hag, with age grown double,<br />
Picking dry sticks, and mumbling to herself.<br />
Her eyes with scalding-rheum were gall&rsquo;d, and red,<br />
Cold palsy shook her head, her hands seemed wither&rsquo;d,<br />
And on her crooked shoulders had she wrapt<br />
The tatter&rsquo;d remnant of an old striped hanging,<br />
Which served to keep her carcass from the cold;<br />
So there was nothing of a piece about her.<br />
Her lower weeds were all o&rsquo;er coarsely patched,<br />
With different colour&rsquo;d rags, black, red, white, yellow.<br />
And seem&rsquo;d to speak variety of wretchedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A picture such as this is enough to create sympathy and charity in a
selfish heart, but in those dark days, when faith in witchcraft prevailed,
such a poor old decrepit woman inspired awe, and was shunned as a malicious
evil-doer by all her neighbours.</p>
<h3><!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span><i>Llanddona Witches</i>.</h3>
<p>There is a tradition in the parish of Llanddona, Anglesey, that these
witches, with their husbands, had been expelled from their native country,
wherever that was, for practising witchcraft.&nbsp; They were sent adrift,
it is said, in a boat, without rudder or oars, and left in this state to
the mercy of the wind and the wave.&nbsp; When they were first discovered
approaching the Anglesey shore, the Welsh tried to drive them back into the
sea, and even after they had landed they were confined to the beach.&nbsp;
The strangers, dead almost from thirst and hunger, commanded a spring of
pure water to burst forth on the sands.&nbsp; This well remains to our
days.&nbsp; This miracle decided their fate.&nbsp; The strangers were
allowed, consequently, to land, but as they still practised their evil arts
the parish became associated with their name, and hence the <i>Witches of
Llanddona</i> was a term generally applied to the female portion of that
parish, though in reality it belonged to one family only within its
boundaries.</p>
<p>The men lived by smuggling and the women by begging and cursing.&nbsp;
It was impossible to overcome these daring smugglers, for in their
neckerchief was a fly, which, the moment the knot of their cravats was
undone, flew right at the eye of their opponents and blinded them, but
before this last remedy was resorted to the men fought like lions, and only
when their strength failed them did they release their familiar spirit, the
fly, to strike with blindness the defenders of the law.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned tradition of the coming of these witches to Anglesey
is still current in the parish of Llanddona, which is situated on the north
coast of Anglesey.</p>
<p>It was thought that the witching power belonged to families, and
descended from mothers to daughters.&nbsp; This was supposed to be the case
with the witches of Llanddona.&nbsp; <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>This family obtained
a bad report throughout the island.&nbsp; The women, with dishevelled hair
and bared breasts, visited farm houses and requested charity, more as a
right than a favour, and no one dared refuse them.&nbsp; <i>Llanddona
Witches</i> is a name that is not likely soon to die.&nbsp; Taking
advantage of the credulity of the people, they cursed those whom they
disliked, and many were the endeavours to counteract their
maledictions.&nbsp; The following is one of their curses, uttered at <i>Y
Ffynon Ocr</i>, a well in the parish of Llanddona, upon a man who had
offended one of these witches:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crwydro y byddo am oesoedd lawer;<br />
Ac yn mhob cam, camfa;<br />
Yn mhob camfa, codwm;<br />
Yn mhob codwm, tori asgwrn;<br />
Nid yr asgwrn mwyaf na&rsquo;r lleiaf,<br />
Ond asgwrn chwil corn ei wddw bob tro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The English is as follows, but the alliteration and rhythm of the Welsh
do not appear in the translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May he wander for ages many;<br />
And at every step, a stile;<br />
At every stile, a fall;<br />
At every fall, a broken bone;<br />
Not the largest, nor the least bone,<br />
But the chief neck bone, every time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This curse seemed to be a common imprecation, possibly belonging to that
family.&nbsp; Such was the terror of the <i>Llanddona Witches</i> that if
any of them made a bid for a pig or anything else, in fair or market, no
one else dared bid against them, for it was believed they would witch the
animal thus bought.&nbsp; There were also celebrated witches at
Denbigh.&nbsp; <i>Bella Fawr</i> (Big Bella) was one of the last and most
famous of her tribe in that town, and many other places were credited with
possessing persons endowed with witching powers, as well as those who could
break spells.</p>
<p><!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>The following tales of the doings of witches will throw light
upon the matter under consideration.</p>
<h3>Witches transforming themselves into Cats.</h3>
<p>One of the forms that witches were supposed to change themselves into
was that of a cat.&nbsp; In this metamorphosed state they were the more
able to accomplish their designs.&nbsp; The following tale, illustrative of
this belief, was told me by the Rev. R. Jones, Rector of Llanycil,
Bala.</p>
<p>On the side of the old road, between Cerrig-y-drudion and
Bettws-y-Coed&mdash;long before this latter place had become the resort of
artists&mdash;stood an inn, which was much resorted to, as it was a
convenient lodging house for travellers on their way to Ireland.&nbsp; This
inn stood near the present village of Bettws-y-Coed.&nbsp; Many robberies
occurred here.&nbsp; Travellers who put up there for the night were
continually deprived of their money, and no one could tell how this
occurred, for the lodgers were certain that no one had entered their rooms,
as they were found locked in the morning just as they were the night
before.&nbsp; The mystery was, therefore, great.&nbsp; By and by, one of
those who had lost his money consulted <i>Huw Llwyd</i>, who lived at
Cynvael, in the parish of Festiniog, and he promised to unravel the
mystery.&nbsp; Now, Huw Llwyd had been an officer in the army, and,
equipped in his regimentals, with sword dangling by his side, he presented
himself one evening at the suspected inn, and asked whether he could obtain
a room and bed for the night; he represented himself as on his way to
Ireland, and he found no difficulty in obtaining a night&rsquo;s
lodging.&nbsp; The inn was kept by two sisters of prepossessing appearance,
and the traveller made himself most agreeable to these ladies, and
entertained them with tales of his travels in foreign parts.&nbsp; On
retiring for the night he stated that it was a habit with him to burn
lights in his room all <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>night, and he was supplied with a sufficient
quantity of candles to last through the night.&nbsp; The request, as Hugh
Llwyd was a military man, did not arouse suspicion.&nbsp; Huw retired, and
made his arrangements for a night of watching.&nbsp; He placed his clothes
on the floor within easy reach of his bed, and his sword unsheathed lay on
the bed close to his right hand.&nbsp; He had secured the door, and now as
the night drew on he was all attention; ere long two cats stealthily came
down the partition between his room and the next to it.&nbsp; Huw feigned
sleep, the cats frisked here and there in the room, but the sleeper awoke
not; they chased each other about the room, and played and romped, and at
last they approached Huw&rsquo;s clothes and played with them, and here
they seemed to get the greatest amusement; they turned the clothes about
and over, placing their paws now on that string, and now on that button,
and ere long their paws were inserted into the pockets of his clothes, and,
just as one of the cats had her paw in the pocket that contained Huw
Llwyd&rsquo;s purse, he like lightning struck the cat&rsquo;s paw with his
sword.&nbsp; With terrible screams they both disappeared, and nothing
further was seen of them during the night.</p>
<p>Next morning, only one of the sisters appeared at the breakfast
table.&nbsp; To the traveller&rsquo;s enquiry after the absent lady of the
house, her sister said that she was slightly indisposed, and could not
appear.</p>
<p>Huw Llwyd expressed regret at this, but, said he&mdash;&ldquo;I must say
good-bye to her, for I greatly enjoyed her company last night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He would not be refused, so ultimately he was admitted to her
presence.&nbsp; After expressing his sympathy and regret at her illness,
the soldier held out his hand to bid good-bye to the lady.&nbsp; She put
out her left hand; this Huw refused to take, averring that he had never
<!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>taken a left hand in his life, and that he would not do so
now.&nbsp; Very reluctantly, and with evident pain, she put out her right
hand, which was bandaged, and this fact cleared up the mystery connected
with the robberies.&nbsp; These two ladies were two witches, who in the
form of cats had robbed travellers who lodged under their roof.&nbsp; Huw,
when he made this discovery said&mdash;&ldquo;I am Huw Llwyd of Cynvael,
and I warn you of the risk you have incurred by your thefts, and I promise
you I will not let you off so easily the next time I have need to visit
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preceding tale is circumstantial, but unfortunately similar tales
are current in other places, as shown by the following
quotation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The last instance of national credulity on this head was the
story of the witches of Thurso, who, tormenting for a long time an honest
fellow under the usual form of a cat, at last provoked him so that one
night he put them to flight with his broad sword and <i>cut off the leg</i>
of one less nimble than the rest.&nbsp; On his taking it up, to his
amazement <i>he found it belonged to a female of his own species</i>, and
next morning discovered the owner, an old hag, with only the companion leg
to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Brand&rsquo;s Popular Antiquities</i>, pp. 318-319.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Witches&rsquo; Revenge on Huw Llwyd.</h3>
<p>Several months after the occurrence recorded above of Huw Llwyd, when he
had just started from his home one Sunday morning to go to his Church to
officiate there, for he was the parson of Llan Festiniog, he observed that
the Bettws-y-Coed ladies were approaching his house, and he perceived that
their object was to witch him.&nbsp; He knew full well that as long as his
back was turned towards them he was in their power, but that when he faced
them they could do him no harm; so; to avoid their evil influence, <!--
page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>and to
frustrate their designs, he faced them, and walked backwards every step
from Cynvael to the Llan, and in this way he escaped being injured by his
female enemies.&nbsp; But this was not all.&nbsp; Huw Llwyd knew that when
he reached the Church porch he was beyond witchcraft&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp;
Having arrived there he shouted out&mdash;&ldquo;I defy you now, and before
I leave the Church I will make you that you can never again witch
anyone.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was as good as his word, for by his skill in the
black art, he deprived those two ladies, ere he left the Church, of their
power to witch people, and during the rest of their lives they were like
other women.</p>
<p>Huw Llwyd, who was born 1533, and died 1620, was a clergyman, and it was
generally believed that priests could counteract the evils of the enemy of
mankind.</p>
<p>The wide-spread belief of witches being able to transform themselves
into animals is shown in the legends of many countries, and, as in the case
of fairy stories, the same tale, slightly changed, may be heard in various
places.&nbsp; The possibility of injuring or <i>marking</i> the witch in
her assumed form so deeply that the bruise remained a mark on her in her
natural form was a common belief.&nbsp; A tale in certain points like the
one recorded of Huw Llwyd and the witches who turned themselves into cats
is to be heard in many parts of Wales.&nbsp; It is as follows.&nbsp; I
quote the main facts from my friend Mr. Hamer&rsquo;s account of
Llanidloes, published in the <i>Montgomeryshire Collections</i>, vol. x.,
p. 243:&mdash;</p>
<h3>A Witch transformed into a Hare injured by one whom she
tormented.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;An old woman, thought to be a witch, was said by a neighbour to
be in the habit of visiting her nightly in the shape of a hare, and that in
consequence she was deprived of her rest.&nbsp; The witch came to her bed,
as a hare, and <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>crossed it, and the tormented one was
determined to put an end to this persecution.&nbsp; For this purpose she
procured a hammer, which she placed under her pillow when she retired to
rest.&nbsp; That night the old witch, unaware of the reception awaiting
her, paid her usual visit to her victim.&nbsp; But the instant she jumped
on the bed she received a stunning blow on the head, and, it need not be
added, disappeared.&nbsp; Next morning, a friend of the persecuted woman,
who was in the secret of the whole case, on some pretext paid the old
woman, the supposed witch, a visit, and she was greatly astonished to find
her laid up, suffering from a frightful black eye, which her visitor
believed to be the result of the blow dealt her with the hammer on the
previous night.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A Witch shot when in the form of a Hare.</h3>
<p>The following tale was told me by the Rev. R. Jones, Rector of
Llanycil:&mdash;</p>
<p>An old woman was evicted from a small farm, which she and her family had
held for many years.&nbsp; She was naturally greatly annoyed at such
conduct on the part of the landlord, and of the person who supplanted
her.&nbsp; However, she procured a small cottage close by her late home,
and there she lived.&nbsp; But the interloper did not get on, for she was
troubled by a hare that came nightly to her house.&nbsp; A labouring man,
when going to his work early in the morning, time after time saw a hare
going from the farm towards the cottage occupied by this old woman, and he
determined to shoot this hare.&nbsp; He procured an old gun, and loaded it
with pebbles instead of shot, and awaited the approach of the hare.&nbsp;
It came as usual, the man fired, and the hare rolled over and over,
screaming and making a terrible noise.&nbsp; He, however, did not heed this
much, for hares, when shot, do scream, and so he went to secure the <!--
page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>hare,
but when he attempted to seize it, it changed into all shapes, and made
horrible sounds, and the man was so terrified that he ran away, and he was
very glad to get away from the scene of this shocking occurrence.&nbsp; In
a few days afterwards the old woman who occupied the cottage was found
dead, and it was noticed by the woman who laid her out that her arm and
shoulder were riddled with pebbles.&nbsp; It was thought that she was a
witch, and that she had troubled the people who had deprived her of her
farm, and that she did so in the shape of a hare, and no one doubted that
the injury inflicted on the old woman was anything more than the shot of
the man, who supposed that he had killed a hare, when in reality he shot
and killed the old woman.&nbsp; The farmer was never troubled after the
death of the woman whom he had supplanted.</p>
<p>Many variants of this tale are still extant.&nbsp; The parish clerk of
Llangadfan, a mountainous parish in Montgomeryshire, gave me one, which he
located in Nant-yr-eira, but as it is in its main points much like the
preceding, I will not relate it.</p>
<h3>A Witch in the form of a Hare in a Churn.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 117, are these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If the dairy-maid does not make her butter come so soon as she
would have it, <i>Moll White</i> (a supposed witch) is at the bottom of the
churn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until very lately I had thought that the milk only was considered
bewitched if it could not be churned, and not that the witch herself was at
the bottom of the churn.&nbsp; But I have been disabused of this false
notion, for the Rector of Llanycil told me the following story, which was
told him by his servant girl, who figures in the tale.&nbsp; When this girl
was servant at Drws-y-nant, near Dolgelley, one day, the milk would not
churn.&nbsp; They worked a long time at it to <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>no purpose.&nbsp; The
girl thought that she heard something knocking up and down in the churn,
and splashing about.&nbsp; She told her master there was something in the
churn, but he would not believe her; however, they removed the lid, and out
jumped a large hare, and ran away through the open door, and this explained
all difficulties, and proved that the milk was bewitched, and that the
witch herself was in the churn in the shape of a hare.</p>
<p>This girl affirmed that she had seen the hare with her own eyes.</p>
<p>As the hare was thought to be a form assumed by witches it was
impossible for ordinary beings to know whether they saw a hare, or a witch
in the form of a hare, when the latter animal appeared and ran before them
along the road, consequently the hare, as well as the witch, augured
evil.&nbsp; An instance of this confusion of ideas was related to the
writer lately by Mr. Richard Jones, Tyn-y-wern, Bryneglwys.</p>
<h3>A Hare crossing the Road.</h3>
<p>Mr. Jones said that when he was a lad, he and his mother went to Caerwys
fair from the Vale of Clwyd, intending to sell a cow at the fair.&nbsp;
They had not gone far on their way before a large hare crossed the road,
hopping and halting and looking around.&nbsp; His mother was vexed at the
sight, and she said&mdash;&ldquo;We may as well go home, Dick, for no good
will come of our journey since that old witch crosses our
path.&rdquo;&nbsp; They went on, though, and reached Caerwys in safety, but
they got no bid for the cow, although they stayed there all day long.</p>
<h3>A Witch in the form of a Hare hunted by a Black Greyhound.</h3>
<p>The writer has heard variants of the following tale in several parts of
Wales:&mdash;</p>
<p>An old woman, credited to be a witch, lived on the <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>confines of the hills
in a small hut in south Carnarvonshire.&nbsp; Her grandson, a sharp
intelligent lad, lived with her.&nbsp; Many gentlemen came to that part
with greyhounds for the purpose of coursing, and the lad&rsquo;s services
were always in requisition, for he never failed in starting a hare, and
whenever he did so he was rewarded with a shilling.&nbsp; But it was
noticed that the greyhounds never caught the hare which the lad
started.&nbsp; The sport was always good, the race long and exciting, but
the hare never failed to elude her pursuers.&nbsp; Scores of times this
occurred, until at last the sportsmen consulted a wise man, who gave it as
his opinion that this was no ordinary hare, but a witch, and, said
he&mdash;&ldquo;She can never be caught but by a black
greyhound.&rdquo;&nbsp; A dog of this colour was sought for far and near,
and at last found and bought.&nbsp; Away to the hills the coursers went,
believing that now the hare was theirs.&nbsp; They called at the cottage
for the lad to accompany them and start the prey.&nbsp; He was as ready as
ever to lead them to their sport.&nbsp; The hare was soon started, and off
the dog was slipped and started after it, and the hare bounded away as
usual, but it is now seen that her pursuer is a match for her in swiftness,
and, notwithstanding the twistings and windings, the dog was soon close
behind the distressed hare.</p>
<p>The race became more and more exciting, for hound and hare exerted
themselves to their very utmost, and the chase became hot, and still
hotter.&nbsp; The spectators shout in their excitement&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Hei!
ci du</i>,&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Hi! black dog</i>,&rdquo;) for it was seen
that he was gaining on his victim.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Hei! Mam</i>,
<i>gu</i>,&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Hei! grandmother</i>, <i>dear</i>,&rdquo;)
shouted the lad, forgetting in his trouble that his grandmother was in the
form of a hare.&nbsp; His was the only encouraging voice uttered on behalf
of the poor hunted hare.&nbsp; His single voice was hardly heard amidst the
shouts of the many.&nbsp; The <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>pursuit was long and hard, dog and hare gave
signs of distress, but shouts of encouragement buoyed up the strength of
the dog.&nbsp; The chase was evidently coming to a close, and the hare was
approaching the spot whence it started.&nbsp; One single heart was filled
with dread and dismay at the failing strength of the hare, and from that
heart came the words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Hei! Mam gu</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Hi!
grandmother</i>, <i>dear</i>.&rdquo;)&nbsp; All followed the chase, which
was now nearing the old woman&rsquo;s cottage, the window of which was
open.&nbsp; With a bound the hare jumped through the small casement into
the cottage, but the black dog was close behind her, and just as she was
disappearing through the window, he bit the hare and retained a piece of
her skin in his mouth, but he could not follow the hare into the cottage,
as the aperture was too small.&nbsp; The sportsmen lost no time in getting
into the cottage, but, after much searching, they failed to discover
puss.&nbsp; They, however, saw the old woman seated by the fire
spinning.&nbsp; They also noticed that there was blood trickling from
underneath her seat, and this they considered sufficient proof that it was
the witch in the form of a hare that had been coursed and had been bitten
by the dog just as she bounded into the cottage.</p>
<p>It was believed in England, as well as in Wales, that witches were often
hunted in the shape of hares.&nbsp; Thus in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 117,
these words occur:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a hare makes an unexpected escape from the hounds the huntsman
curses <i>Moll White</i> (the witch)!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; (says
Sir Roger,) &ldquo;I have known the master of the pack, upon such an
occasion, send one of his servants to see if <i>Moll White</i> had been out
that morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Yorkshire Legends and Traditions</i>, p. 160, is a tale very much
like the one which is given above.&nbsp; It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a hare which baffled all the greyhounds that <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>were slipped
at her.&nbsp; They seemed to have no more chance with her than if they
coursed the wind.&nbsp; There was, at the time, a noted witch residing
near, and her advice was asked about this wonderful hare.&nbsp; She seemed
to have little to say about it, however, only she thought they had better
let it be, but, above all, they must take care how they slipped a
<i>black</i> dog at it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, either from recklessness or
from defiance, the party did go out coursing, soon after, with a black
dog.&nbsp; The dog was slipped, and they perceived at once that puss was at
a disadvantage.&nbsp; She made as soon as possible for a stone wall, and
endeavoured to escape through a sheep-hole at the bottom.&nbsp; Just as she
reached this hole the dog threw himself upon her and caught her in the
haunch, but was unable to hold her.&nbsp; She got through and was seen no
more.&nbsp; The sportsmen, either in bravado or from terror of the
consequences, went straight to the house of the witch to inform her of what
had happened.&nbsp; They found her in bed, hurt, she said, by a fall; but
the wound looked very much as if it had been produced by the teeth of a
dog, and it was on a part of the woman corresponding to that by which the
hare had been seized by the black hound before their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Early reference to Witches turning themselves into Hares.</h3>
<p>The prevalence of the belief that witches could transform themselves
into hares is seen from a remark made by <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i> in his
topography of Ireland.&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It has also been a frequent complaint, from old times, as well as
in the present, <i>that certain hags in Wales</i>, as well as in Ireland
and Scotland, <i>changed themselves into the shape of hares</i>, that,
sucking teats under this counterfeit, they might stealthily rob other
people&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>, Bohn&rsquo;s Edition, p. 83.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>This remark of the Archdeacon&rsquo;s gives a respectable
antiquity to the metamorphosis of witches, for it was in 1185 that he
visited Ireland, and he tells us that what he records had descended from
&ldquo;old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transformation fables that have descended to us would seem to be
fossils of a pagan faith once common to the Celtic and other cognate
races.&nbsp; It was not thought that certain harmless animals only could
become the temporary abode of human beings.&nbsp; Even a wolf could be
human under an animal form.&nbsp; Thus <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i> records
that a priest was addressed in Ireland by a wolf, and induced to administer
the consolations of his priestly office to his wife, who, also, under the
shape of a she-wolf was apparently at the point of death, and to convince
the priest that she was really a human being the he-wolf, her husband, tore
off the skin of the she-wolf from the head down to the navel, folding it
back, and she immediately presented the form of an old woman to the
astonished priest.&nbsp; These people were changed into wolves through the
curse of one Natalis, Saint and Abbot, who compelled them every seven years
to put off the human form and depart from the dwellings of men as a
punishment for their sins.&nbsp; (See <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>,
Bohn&rsquo;s Edition, pp. 79-81.)</p>
<h3>Ceridwen and Gwion (Gwiawn) Bach&rsquo;s
Transformation.</h3>
<p>But a striking instance of rapid transition from one form to another is
given in the <i>Mabinogion</i>.&nbsp; The fable of Ceridwen&rsquo;s
cauldron is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ceridwen was the wife of Tegid Voel.&nbsp; They had a son named
Morvran, and a daughter named Creirwy, and she was the most beautiful girl
in the world, and they had another son named Avagddu, the ugliest man in
the world.&nbsp; Ceridwen, seeing that he should not be received amongst
gentlemen because of his ugliness, unless he should be <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>possessed of some
excellent knowledge or strength . .&nbsp;  . . ordered a cauldron to be
boiled of knowledge and inspiration for her son.&nbsp; The cauldron was to
be boiled unceasingly for one year and a day until there should be in it
three blessed drops of the spirit&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These three drops fell on the finger of Gwion Bach of Llanfair
Caereinion in Powis, whom she ordered to attend to the cauldron.&nbsp; The
drops were so hot that Gwion Bach put his finger to his mouth; no sooner
done, than he came to know all things.&nbsp; Now he <i>transformed himself
into a hare</i>, and ran away from the wrath of Ceridwen.&nbsp; She also
<i>transformed herself into a greyhound</i>, and went after him to the side
of a river.&nbsp; Gwion on this jumped into the river and transformed
himself into a fish.&nbsp; She also transformed herself into an
otter-bitch, and chased him under the water until he was fain to turn
himself into a bird of the air; she, as a hawk, followed him, and gave him
no rest in the sky.&nbsp; And just as she was about to swoop upon him, and
he was in fear of death, he espied a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of
a barn, and he dropped among the wheat and buried himself into one of the
grains.&nbsp; Then she transformed herself into a high-crested black hen,
and went to the wheat and scratched it with her feet, and found him and
swallowed him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tale of Ceridwen, whose fame was such that she can without
exaggeration be styled the goddess of witches, resembles in part the chase
of the witch-hare by the black dog, and probably her story gave rise to
many tales of transformations.</p>
<p>I now come to another kind of transformation.&nbsp; It was believed by
the aged in Wales that witches could not only turn themselves into hares,
but that by incantation they could change other people into animals.&nbsp;
My friend, the <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>Rev. T. Lloyd Williams, Wrexham, lodged whilst
he was at Ystrad Meurig School with a Mrs. Jones, Dolfawr, who was a firm
believer in &ldquo;Rhibo&rdquo; or Rheibo, or witching, and this lady told
my friend the following tales of <i>Betty&rsquo;r Bont</i>, a celebrated
witch in those parts.</p>
<h3>A Man turned into a Hare.</h3>
<p>One of the servant men at Dolfawr, some years before Mr. Williams lodged
there, laughed at Betty&rsquo;r Bont&rsquo;s supposed power.&nbsp; However,
he lived to repent his folly.&nbsp; One night after he had gone to bed he
found that he had been changed into a hare, and to his dismay and horror he
saw a couple of greyhounds slipped upon him.&nbsp; He ran for bare life,
and managed to elude his pursuers, and in a terrible plight and fright he
ran to Dolfawr, and to his bed.&nbsp; This kind of transformation he ever
afterwards was subjected to, until by spells he was released from the
witch&rsquo;s power over him.</p>
<h3>A Man changed into a Horse.</h3>
<p>Mr. Williams writes of the same servant man who figures in the preceding
tale:&mdash;&rdquo;However, after that, she (Betty&rsquo;r Bont) turned him
into a grey mare, saddled him, and actually rode him herself; and when he
woke in the morning, he was in a bath of perspiration, and positively
declared that he had been galloping all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singularly enough <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i> mentions the same kind of
transformation.&nbsp; His words are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I myself, at the time I was in Italy, heard it said of some
districts in those parts, that there the stable-women, who had learnt
magical arts, were wont to give something to travellers in their cheese,
which transformed them into beasts of burden, so that they carried all
sorts of burdens, and after they had performed their tasks, resumed their
own forms.&rdquo;&mdash;Bohn&rsquo;s Edition, p. 83.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>From Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular Antiquities</i>, p. 225, I find
that a common name for <i>nightmare</i> was <i>witch-riding</i>, and the
night-mare, he tells us, was &ldquo;a spectre of the night, which seized
men in their sleep and suddenly deprived them of speech and motion,&rdquo;
and he quotes from Ray&rsquo;s Collection of Proverbs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Go in God&rsquo;s name, so <i>ride</i> no witches.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will now leave this subject with the remark that people separated by
distance are often brought together by their superstitions, and probably,
these beliefs imply a common origin of the people amongst whom these myths
prevail.</p>
<p>The following tales show how baneful the belief in witchcraft was; but,
nevertheless, there was some good even in such superstitions, for people
were induced, through fear of being witched, to be charitable.</p>
<h3>A Witch who turned a Blue Dye into a Red Dye.</h3>
<p>An old hag went to a small farmhouse in Clocaenog parish, and found the
farmer&rsquo;s wife occupied in dyeing wool blue.&nbsp; She begged for a
little wool and blue dye.&nbsp; She was informed by Mrs. --- that she was
really very sorry that she could not part with either, as she had only just
barely enough for her own use.&nbsp; The hag departed, and the woman went
on with her dyeing, but to her surprise, the wool came out of the pot dyed
red instead of blue.&nbsp; She thought that possibly it was the dye that
was to blame, and so she gave up for the night her employment, and the next
day she went to Ruthin for a fresh supply of blue to finish her work, but
again she failed to dye the wool blue, for red, and not blue, was the
result of her dyeing.&nbsp; She, in surprise, told a neighbour of her
unaccountable failure to dye her wool blue.&nbsp; This neighbour asked her
if she had been visited by anyone, and she in answer told her that old so
and so had been at her house begging.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; was the
response, &ldquo;I see <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>how it is you can never dye that wool blue,
you have been witched, send the red wool and the part that you have not
touched here to me, and I will finish the work for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was done, and the same colour was used by both women, but now it became
blue, whilst with the other, it was red.</p>
<p>This tale was told me by a gentleman who does not wish his name to
appear in print, as it would lead to the identification of the parties
mentioned, and the descendants of the supposed witch, being respectable
farmers, would rather that the tale of their canny grandmother were
forgotten, but my informant vouches for the truth of the tale.</p>
<h3>A Pig Witched.</h3>
<p>A woman sold a pig at Beaumaris to a man called Dick y Green; she could
not that day sell any more, but the following market day she went again to
Beaumaris.&nbsp; Dick was there waiting her appearance, and he told her
that the pig he bought was bewitched and she must come with him to undo the
curse.&nbsp; Away the woman went with Dick, and when they came to the pig
she said, &ldquo;What am I to do now, Dick?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Draw thy
hand seven times down his back,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;and say every
time, &lsquo;<i>Rhad Duw arnat ti</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;The
blessing of God be on thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman did so, and then Dick
went for physic for the pig, which recovered.</p>
<h3>Milk that would not churn, and the steps taken to counteract
the malice of the Witch that had cursed the churn and its
contents.</h3>
<p>Before beginning this tale, it should be said that some witches were
able to make void the curses of other witches.&nbsp; Bella of Denbigh, who
lived in the early part of the present century, was one of these, and her
renown extended over many counties.</p>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>I may further add that my informant is the Rev. R. Jones, whom I
have often mentioned, who is a native of Llanfrothen, the scene of the
occurrences I am about to relate, and that he was at one time curate of
Denbigh, so that he would be conversant with the story by hearsay, both as
to its evil effects and its remedy.</p>
<p>About the year 1815 an old woman, supposed to be a witch, lived at
Ffridd Ucha, Llanfrothen, and she got her living by begging.&nbsp; One day
she called at Ty mawr, in the same parish, requesting a charity of milk;
but she was refused.&nbsp; The next time they churned, the milk would not
turn to butter, they continued their labours for many hours, but at last
they were compelled to desist in consequence of the unpleasant odour which
proceeded from the churn.&nbsp; The milk was thrown away, and the farmer,
John Griffiths, divining that the milk had been witched by the woman who
had been begging at their house, went to consult a conjuror, who lived near
Pwllheli.&nbsp; This man told him that he was to put a red hot crowbar into
the milk the next time they churned.&nbsp; This was done, and the milk was
successfully churned.&nbsp; For several weeks the crowbar served as an
antidote, but at last it failed, and again the milk could not be churned,
and the unpleasant smell made it again impossible for anyone to stand near
the churn.&nbsp; Griffiths, as before, consulted the Pwllheli conjuror, who
gave him a charm to place underneath the churn, stating, when he did so,
that if it failed, he could render no further assistance.&nbsp; The charm
did not act, and a gentleman whom he next consulted advised him to go to
Bell, or Bella, the Denbigh witch.&nbsp; Griffiths did so, and to his great
surprise he found that Bell could describe the position of his house, and
she knew the names of his fields.&nbsp; Her instructions were&mdash;Gather
all the cattle to Gors Goch field, a meadow in <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>front of the house,
and then she said that the farmer and a friend were to go to a certain
holly tree, and stand out of sight underneath this tree, which to this day
stands in the hedge that surrounds the meadow mentioned by Bell.&nbsp; This
was to be done by night, and the farmer was told that he should then see
the person who had injured him.&nbsp; The instructions were literally
carried out.&nbsp; When the cows came to the field they herded together in
a frightened manner, and commenced bellowing fearfully.&nbsp; In a very
short time, who should enter the field but the suspected woman in evident
bodily pain, and Griffiths and his friend heard her uttering some words
unintelligible to them, and having done so, she disappeared, and the cattle
became quiet, and ever after they had no difficulty in churning the milk of
those cows.</p>
<p>The two following tales were told the writer by the Rev. T. Lloyd
Williams, Wrexham.&nbsp; The scene of the stories was Cardiganshire, and
Betty&rsquo;r Bont was the witch.</p>
<h3>A Witch who was refused a Goose, and her revenge.</h3>
<p>A witch called at a farm when they were feathering geese for sale, and
she begged much for one.&nbsp; She was refused, but it would have been
better, according to the tale, had her request been granted, for they could
not afterwards rear geese on that farm.</p>
<p>Another version of the preceding tale is, that the same witch called at
a farm when the family was seated at dinner partaking of a goose; she
requested a taste, but was refused, when leaving the house door she was
heard to mutter, &ldquo;Let there be no more geese at . . .&rdquo; and her
curse became a fact.</p>
<h3>A Witch refused Butter, and the consequence.</h3>
<p>An old hag called at a farm and begged the wife to sell her a pound of
butter.&nbsp; This was refused, as they wanted to <!-- page 241--><a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>pot the butter.&nbsp;
The witch went away, therefore, empty handed.&nbsp; The next day when the
maid went to the fields for the cows she found them sitting like cats
before a fire, with their hind legs beneath them.&nbsp; I am indebted to my
friend Mr. Lloyd Williams for this tale.&nbsp; A friend told me the
following tale.</p>
<h3>A Witch&rsquo;s Revenge, and her Discomfiture.</h3>
<p>An old beggar woman was refused her requests by a farmer&rsquo;s wife,
and it was noticed that she uttered words that might have been a threat,
when going away from the door, and it was also observed that she picked up
a few straws from the yard and carried them away with her.&nbsp; In the
course of a few days, a healthy calf died, and the death of several calves
followed in rapid succession.&nbsp; These misfortunes caused the wife to
remember the old woman whom she had sent away from her door, and the farmer
came to the conclusion that his cattle had been witched by this old woman,
so he went to a conjuror, who told him to cut out the heart of the next
calf that should die, and roast it before the fire, and then, after it had
been properly roasted, he was to prick it all over with a fork, and if
anyone should appear as a beggar, they were to give her what she
asked.&nbsp; The instructions were carried out literally, and just as the
heart was being pricked, the old woman whom the wife had driven away came
up to the house in a dreadful state, and rushing into the house,
said&mdash;&ldquo;In the name of God, what are you doing here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
She was told that they were doing nothing particular, and while the
conversation was being carried on, the pricking operation was discontinued
and the old hag became less excited, and then she asked the farmer kindly
to give her a few potatoes, which he gladly did, and the old woman
departed; and no more calves died after that.</p>
<p><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>Tales of the kind related above are extremely common, and might
be multiplied to almost any extent.&nbsp; It would seem that the evil
influence of witches was exerted not only at times when they were refused
favours, but that, at will, they could accomplish mischief.&nbsp; Thus I
have heard it said of an old woman, locally supposed to be a witch, that
her very presence was ominous of evil, and disaster followed wherever she
went; if she were inclined to work evil she was supposed to be able to do
so, and that without any provocation.</p>
<p>I will give one tale which I heard in Garthbeibio of this old
hag&rsquo;s doings.</p>
<h3>A Horse Witched.</h3>
<p>Pedws Ffoulk, a supposed witch, was going through a field where people
were employed at work, and just as she came opposite the horse it fell
down, as if it were dead.&nbsp; The workmen ran to the horse to ascertain
what was the matter with it, but Pedws went along, not heeding what had
occurred.&nbsp; This unfeeling conduct on her part roused the suspicion of
the men, and they came to the conclusion that the old woman had witched the
horse, and that she was the cause of its illness.&nbsp; They, therefore,
determined to run after the woman and bring her back to undo her own evil
work.&nbsp; Off they rushed after her, and forced her back to the field,
where the horse was still lying on the ground.&nbsp; They there compelled
the old creature to say, standing over the horse, these
words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Duw arno fo</i>&rdquo; (God be with him).&nbsp; This
she did, and then she was allowed to go on her way.&nbsp; By and by the
horse revived, and got upon his feet, and looked as well as ever, but this,
it was thought, would not have been the case had not the witch undone her
own curse.</p>
<p>In Anglesey, as I was informed by my brother, the late Rev. Elijah Owen,
Vicar of Llangoed, it was believed that witches <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>made void their own
curses of animals by saying over them &ldquo;<i>Rhad Duw ar y da</i>&rdquo;
(The Blessing of God be on the cattle).</p>
<h3>Cows and Horses Witched.</h3>
<p>The writer was told the name of the farm where the following events were
said to have taken place, but he is not quite sure that his memory has not
deceived him, so he will only relate the facts without giving them a
locality.</p>
<p>A farmer had a good mare that went mad, she foamed at the mouth, rushed
about the stall, and died in great agony.&nbsp; But this was not all, his
cows kept back their milk, and what they could extract from them stank, nor
could they churn the milk, for it turned into froth.</p>
<p>A conjuror was consulted, and the farmer was told that all this evil had
been brought about by a witch who had been refused milk at his door, and
her mischief was counteracted by the conjuror thus consulted.</p>
<p>Occasionally we hear of injured persons retaliating upon the witches who
had brought about their losses.&nbsp; This, however, was not often
attempted, for people feared the consequences of a failure, but it was,
nevertheless, supposed to be attainable.</p>
<p>I will relate a few instances of this punishment of witches for their
evil doings.</p>
<h3>Witches Punished.</h3>
<p>A neighbour, who does not wish to have his name recorded, states that he
can vouch for the incidents in the following tale.&nbsp; A farmer who lost
much stock by death, and suspected it was the work of an old hag who lived
in his neighbourhood, consulted a conjuror about the matter, and he was
told that his suspicions were correct, that his losses were brought about
by this old woman, and, added the conjuror, if you wish it, I can wreak
vengeance on the wretch for what she has done to your cattle.&nbsp; The
injured <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>farmer was not averse to punishing the woman, but he did not wish
her punishment to be over severe, and this he told the conjuror, but said
he, &ldquo;I should like her to be deprived of the power to injure anyone
in future.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was accomplished, my informant told me, for
the witch-woman took to her bed, and became unable to move about from that
very day to the end of her life.&nbsp; My informant stated that he had
himself visited this old woman on her sick bed, and that she did not look
ill, but was disinclined to get up, and the cause of it all was a matter of
general gossip in the neighbourhood, that she had been cursed for her evil
doings.</p>
<p>Another tale I have heard is that a conjuror obliged a witch to jump
from a certain rock into the river that ran at its foot, and thus put an
end to her life.</p>
<p>Rough punishment was often inflicted upon these simple old women by
silly people.</p>
<p>The tales already given are sufficiently typical of the faith of the
credulous regarding witches, and their ability to work out their evil
desires on their victims.&nbsp; I will now proceed briefly to relate other
matters connected with witchcraft as believed in, in all parts of
Wales.</p>
<h3>How to break, or protect people from, a Witch&rsquo;s
Spell.</h3>
<p>There were various ways of counteracting the evils brought upon people
by witches.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The intervention of a priest or minister of religion made
curses of none effect.</p>
<p>The following tale was told me by my friend the Rector of
Rhydycroesau.&nbsp; When Mr. Jones was curate of Llanyblodwel a parishioner
sent to ask the &ldquo;parson&rdquo; to come to see her.&nbsp; He went, but
he could not make out what he had been sent for, as the woman was, to all
appearance, in her usual health.&nbsp; Perceiving a strong-looking woman
before him he said, &ldquo;I presume I have missed the house, a sick <!--
page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>person
wished to see me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer was, &ldquo;You are quite right,
Sir, I sent for you, I am not well; I am troubled.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
course of conversation Mr. Jones ascertained that the woman had sent for
him to counteract the evil machinations of her enemy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
witched,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and a parson can break the
spell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The clergyman argued with her, but all to no
purpose.&nbsp; She affirmed that she was witched, and that a clergyman
could withdraw the curse.&nbsp; Finding that the woman was obdurate he read
a chapter and offered up a prayer, and wishing the woman good day with a
hearty &ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; he departed.&nbsp; Upon a subsequent
visit he found the woman quite well, and he was informed by her, to his
astonishment, that he had broken the spell.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Forcing the supposed witch to say over the cursed animals,
&ldquo;<i>Rhad Duw ar y da</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessing be on
the cattle&rdquo;), or some such expressions, freed them from spells.</p>
<p>An instance of this kind is related on page 242, under the heading,
&ldquo;A Horse Witched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Reading the Bible over, or to, the bewitched freed them from
evil.</p>
<p>This was an antidote that could be exercised by anyone who could procure
a Bible.&nbsp; In an essay written in Welsh, relating to the parishes of
Garthbeibio, Llangadfan, and Llanerfyl, in 1863, I find the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwr arall, ffarmwr mawr, a chanddo fuwch yn sal ar y Sabbath, ar
ol rhoddi <i>physic</i> iddi, tybiwyd ei bod yn marw, rhedodd yntau
i&rsquo;r ty i nol y Bibl, <i>a darllenodd bennod iddi</i>;&rdquo; which
rendered into English, is:&mdash;</p>
<p>Another man, a large farmer, having a cow sick on the Sabbath day, after
giving her physic, supposing she was dying, ran into the house to fetch the
Bible, and <i>read a chapter to her</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>4.&nbsp; A Bible kept in a house was a protection from all
evil.</p>
<p>This was a talisman, formerly only within the reach of the
opulent.&nbsp; Quoting again from the essay above referred to, I find these
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Byddai ambell Bibl mewn <i>ty mawr</i> yn cael ei gadw mewn cist
neu goffr a chlo arno, tuag at gadw y ty rhag niwaid.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is:&mdash;</p>
<p>A Bible was occasionally kept in the bettermost farms in a chest which
was locked, to protect the house from harm.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; A ring made of the mountain ash acted as a talisman.</p>
<p>Rings made of this wood were generally placed under the doorposts to
frustrate the evil designs of witches, and the inmates dwelt securely when
thus protected.&nbsp; This tree was supposed to be a famous charm against
witchcraft.</p>
<p>Mrs. Susan Williams, Garth, a farm on the confines of Efenechtyd parish,
Denbighshire, told the writer that E. Edwards, Llwynybrain, Gwyddelwern,
was famous for breaking spells, and consequently his aid was often
required.&nbsp; Susan stated that they could not churn at Foel Fawn,
Derwen.&nbsp; They sent for Edwards, who came, and offered up a kind of
prayer, and then placed a ring made of the bark or of the wood of the
mountain ash (she could not recollect which) underneath the churn, or the
lid of the churn, and thus the spell was broken.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; A horse-shoe found on a road or field, and nailed either on or
above the door of a house or stable, was considered a protection from
spells.</p>
<p>I have seen horse-shoes hanging by a string above a door, and likewise
nailed with the open part upwards, on the door lintel, but quite as often I
have observed that the open part is downwards; but however hung, on
enquiry, the object is the same, viz., to secure luck and prevent evil.</p>

247</span>7.&nbsp; Drawing blood from a witch or conjuror by anyone
incapacitated these evil doers from working out their designs upon the
person who spilt their blood.</p>
<p>I was told of a tailor&rsquo;s apprentice, who on the termination of his
time, having heard, and believing, that his master was a conjuror, when
saying good-bye doubled up his fingers and struck the old man on the nose,
making his blood spurt in all directions.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,
master,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no ill will between us, but you can
now do me no harm, for I have drawn your blood, and you cannot witch
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Drawing blood from a bewitched animal breaks the spell.</p>
<p>In the days of my youth, at Llanidloes, a couple of valuable horses were
said to be bewitched, and they were bled to break the spell.&nbsp; If blood
could not be got from horses and cattle, it was considered to be a positive
proof that they were bewitched, and unless the spell could be broken,
nothing, it was said, could save them from death.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; It was generally thought that if a witch said the word
&ldquo;God&rdquo; to a child or person, whom she had bewitched, it would
&ldquo;undo her work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Edward Hamer, in his &ldquo;Parochial Account of
Llanidloes,&rdquo; published in <i>The Montgomeryshire Collections</i>,
vol. x., p. 242, records an instance of this belief.&nbsp; His words
are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;About fifty years ago the narrator was walking up Long Bridge
Street, when he saw a large crowd in one of the yards leading from the
street to a factory.&nbsp; Upon making his way to the centre of this crowd,
he saw an old woman in a &lsquo;fit,&rsquo; real or feigned, he could not
say, but he believed the latter, and over her stood an angry, middle-aged
man, gesticulating violently, and threatening the old dame, that <!-- page
248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>he would
hang her from an adjacent beam if she would not pronounce the word
&lsquo;God&rsquo; to a child which was held in its mother&rsquo;s arms
before her.&nbsp; It was in vain that the old woman protested her
innocence; in vain that she said that by complying with his request she
would stand before them a confessed witch; in vain that she fell into one
fit after another, and prayed to be allowed to depart; not a sympathising
face could she for some time see in the crowd, until the wife of a
manufacturer, who lived close by, appeared on the scene, who also pleaded
in vain on her behalf.&nbsp; Terrified beyond all measure, and scarcely
knowing what she did, the old woman mumbled something to the child.&nbsp;
It smiled.&nbsp; The angry parents were satisfied the spell was broken, the
crowd dispersed, and the old woman was allowed to depart
quietly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10.&nbsp; The earth from a churchyard sprinkled over any place preserved
it from spells.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts, Plas Einion, Llanfair D. Clwyd, a very aged farmer, told me
that when a certain main or cock fighting had been arranged, his
father&rsquo;s servant man, suspecting unfair play, and believing that his
master&rsquo;s birds had been bewitched, went to the churchyard and carried
therefrom a quantity of consecrated earth, with which he slyly sprinkled
the cock pit, and thus he averted the evil, and broke the spell, and all
the birds fought, and won, according to their deserts.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Anything taken into a church belonging to a farm supposed to
be cursed broke the spell or curse laid upon the place from which that
thing was taken.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, when the writer was curate of Llanwnog,
Montgomeryshire, a Mrs. Hughes, a farmer&rsquo;s wife, who was a firm
believer in omens, charms, and spells, told me that she knew nothing would
come of the spell against <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>so and so, and when asked to explain the
matter, she said that she had seen straw taken from that farm to kindle the
fire in the church, and thus, she said, the spell was broken.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; A pin thrust into &ldquo;Witch&rsquo;s Butter&rdquo; would
cause the witch to undo her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witch&rsquo;s Butter&rdquo; is the name given to a kind of fungus
that grows on decayed wood.&nbsp; The fungus resembles little lumps of
butter, and hence its name.&nbsp; Should anyone think himself witched, all
that he has got to do is to procure &ldquo;witch&rsquo;s butter,&rdquo; and
then thrust a pin into it.&nbsp; It was thought that this pin penetrated
the wicked witch, and every pin thrust into the fungus went into her body,
and thus she was forced to appear, and undo her mischief, and be herself
relieved from bodily pain by relieving others.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; A conjuror&rsquo;s charm could master a witch&rsquo;s
spell.</p>
<p>It was thought that when a person was under a witch&rsquo;s spell he
could get relief and punish the witch by procuring a charm from a
conjuror.&nbsp; This charm was a bit of paper, often covered with illegible
writing, but whatever was on it made no great difference, for the persons
who procured the charms were usually illiterate.&nbsp; The process was as
follows:&mdash;The party cursed took the charm, and thrust a pin through
it, and having waited awhile to see whether the witch would appear or not,
proceeded to thrust another pin through the paper, and if the witch were
tardy in appearing, pin after pin was thrust into the paper, and every pin,
it was thought, went into the body of the spiteful hag, and brought her
ultimately to the house where her curse was being broken, in shocking pain,
and when there it was believed she would say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Duw gatto bobpeth ag a feddwch chwi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God preserve everything which you possess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>14.&nbsp; Certain plants were supposed to possess the power of
destroying charms.</p>
<p><!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>The Rev. D. James, Rector of Garthbeibio, was asked by Evan
Williams, the Voel, a parishioner, whether he feared witches, and when
answered in the negative, his interrogator appeared surprised; however,
awhile afterwards, Williams went to the Rectory, and told the rector that
he knew why he did not fear witches, and proceeded to tell him that he had
seen a plant in the front of the rectory that protected the house from
charms.&nbsp; This was what he called, <i>Meipen Fair</i>.&nbsp; In some
parts of England the snapdragon is supposed to possess a like virtue, and
also the elder tree.</p>
<p>Mr. Davies, schoolmaster, Llangedwyn, informed the writer that at one
time hyssop was hung on the inside of the house door to protect the inmates
from charms.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; The seventh daughter could destroy charms.&nbsp; The seventh
son was thought to possess supernatural power, and so also was the seventh
daughter, but her influence seems to have been exerted against
witchcraft.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; The sign of the cross on the door made the inmates
invulnerable, and when made with the finger on the breast it was a
protection from evil.</p>
<p>The sign of the cross made on the person was once common in Wales, and
the advice given by the aged when a person was in any difficulty was
&ldquo;<i>ymgroesa</i>,&rdquo; cross yourself.&nbsp; The custom of crossing
the door on leaving the house lingered long in many places, and, I think,
it is not altogether given up in our days.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Invoking the aid of the Holy Trinity.&nbsp; This was resorted
to, as seen in the charm given on page 270, when animals were witched.</p>
<h3>The way to find out whether a Hag is a Witch or not.</h3>
<p>It was generally supposed that a witch could not pray, and one way of
testing her guilty connection with the evil one was to ascertain whether
she could repeat the Lord&rsquo;s <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Prayer
correctly.&nbsp; If she failed to do so, she was pronounced to be a
witch.&nbsp; This test, as everyone knows, must have been a fallacious one,
for there are good living illiterate people who are incapable of saying
their <i>Pader</i>; but such was the test, and failure meant death.</p>
<p>Some fifty years ago, when the writer was a lad in school, he noticed a
crowd in Short Bridge Street, Llanidloes, around an aged decrepit woman,
apparently a stranger from the hill country, and on inquiring what was
going on, he was told that the woman was a suspected witch, and that they
were putting her to the test.&nbsp; I believe she was forced to go on her
knees, and use the name of God, and say the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp;
However, the poor frightened thing got successfully through the ordeal, and
I saw her walk away from her judges.</p>
<p>Another manner for discovering a witch was to weigh her against the
Church Bible; if the Bible went up, she was set at liberty, if, on the
other hand, she were lighter than the Bible, she was a witch, and forfeited
her life.</p>
<p>Swimming a witch was another method, and this was the one generally
resorted to.&nbsp; The suspected person was taken to a river or pool of
water, her feet and hands were tied, and she was thrown in; if she sank she
was innocent, if she floated she was a witch, and never reached the bank
alive.</p>
<p>Such as the preceding were some of the ridiculous trials to which poor,
badly clad, aged, toothless, and wrinkled women were put by their
superstitious neighbours to ascertain whether these miserable women were in
league with the devil.</p>
<h2>CONJURORS.</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp; It was formerly believed that men could sell themselves to the
devil, and thus become the possessors of supernatural power.&nbsp; These
men were looked upon as malicious conjurors.</p>
<p><!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>2.&nbsp; Another species of conjurors practised magical arts,
having obtained their knowledge from the study of books.&nbsp; These were
accounted able to thwart the designs of evil workers of every
description.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; There was another class of men supposed to have obtained
strange power from their ancestors.&nbsp; They were looked upon as charmers
and conjurors by descent.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Those who belonged to the first-mentioned class were not in
communion with the Church, and the first step taken by them to obtain their
object was to unbaptize themselves.&nbsp; The process was as
follows:&mdash;The person who wished to sell himself to the devil went to a
Holy Well, took water therefrom three times into his mouth, and spurted it
out in a derisive manner, and thus having relieved himself, as it was
thought, of his baptismal vow, he was ready and fit to make a contract with
the evil one.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The second kind of conjurors obtained their knowledge of the
occult science from the study of books.&nbsp; Generally learned men were by
the ignorant supposed to possess uncanny power.&nbsp; When the writer lived
in Carnarvonshire he was informed that Owen Williams, Waenfawr, had magical
books kept in a box under lock and key, and that he never permitted anyone
to see them.&nbsp; Poor Owen Williams, I wonder whether he knew of the
popular rumour!</p>
<p>The following tale of Huw Llwyd&rsquo;s books I obtained from the Rev.
R. Jones, rector of Llanycil.</p>
<h3>Huw Llwyd and his Magical Books.</h3>
<p>The story, as it has reached our days, is as follows:&mdash;It is said
that Huw Llwyd had two daughters; one of an inquisitive turn of mind, like
himself, while the other resembled her mother, and cared not for
books.&nbsp; On his death bed he called his learned daughter to his side,
and directed her to take his books on the dark science, and throw them <!--
page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>into a
pool, which he named, from the bridge that spanned the river.&nbsp; The
girl went to Llyn Pont Rhyd-ddu with the books, and stood on the bridge,
watching the whirlpool beneath, but she could not persuade herself to throw
them over, and thus destroy her father&rsquo;s precious treasures.&nbsp; So
she determined to tell him a falsehood, and say that she had cast them into
the river.&nbsp; On her return home her father asked her whether she had
thrown the books into the pool, and on receiving an answer in the
affirmative, he, inquiring whether she had seen anything strange when the
books reached the river, was informed that she had seen nothing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have not complied with my
request.&nbsp; I cannot die until the books are thrown into the
pool.&rdquo;&nbsp; She took the books a second time to the river, and now,
very reluctantly, she hurled them into the pool, and watched their
descent.&nbsp; They had not reached the water before two hands appeared,
stretched upward, out of the pool, and these hands caught the books before
they touched the water and, clutching them carefully, both the books and
the hands disappeared beneath the waters.&nbsp; She went home immediately,
and again appeared before her father, and in answer to his question, she
related what had occurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know
you have thrown them in, and I can now die in peace,&rdquo; which he
forthwith did.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Hereditary conjurors, or charmers, were thought to be
beneficial to society.&nbsp; They were charmers rather than
conjurors.&nbsp; In this category is to be reckoned:&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) The seventh son of a family of sons, born the one after the
other.</p>
<p>(b) The seventh daughter in a family of daughters, born in succession,
without a brother between.&nbsp; This person could undo spells and curses,
but she could not herself curse others.</p>
<p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>(c) The descendants of a person, who had eaten eagles&rsquo;
flesh could, for nine generations, charm for the shingles, or, as it is
called in Welsh, <i>Swyno&rsquo;r &rsquo;Ryri</i>.</p>
<p>Conjurors were formerly quite common in Wales; when I say common, I mean
that there was no difficulty in obtaining their aid when required, and they
were within easy reach of those who wished to consult them.&nbsp; Some
became more celebrated than others, and consequently their services were in
greater requisition; but it may be said, that each district had its wise
man.</p>
<p>The office of the conjuror was to counteract the machinations of
witches, and to deliver people from their spells.&nbsp; They were looked
upon as the natural enemies of witches.&nbsp; Instances have already been
given of this antagonism.</p>
<p>But conjurors could act on their own account, and if they did not show
the same spiteful nature as witches, they, nevertheless, were credited with
possessing great and dangerous power.&nbsp; They dealt freely in charms and
spells, and obtained large sums of money for their talismanic papers.&nbsp;
They could, it was believed, by their incantations reveal the future, and
oblige light-fingered people to restore the things they had stolen.</p>
<p>Even a fishing rod made by a conjuror was sure to bring luck to the
fisherman.&nbsp; Lovers and haters alike resorted to the wise man to attain
through his aid their object.</p>
<p>There were but few, if any, matters beyond their comprehension, and
hence the almost unbounded confidence placed in these impostors by the
superstitious and credulous.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, even in this century there are many who still
consult these deceivers, but more of this by and by.</p>
<p>I will now relate a few tales of the doings of these conjurors, and from
them the reader can infer how baneful their influence was upon the rustic
population of Wales.</p>
<h3><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span><i>The Magician&rsquo;s Glass</i>.</h3>
<p>This glass, into which a person looked when he wished to solve the
future, or to ascertain whom he or she was to marry, was used by Welsh, as
well as other magicians.&nbsp; The glass gave back the features of the
person sought after, and reflected the future career of the seeker after
the hidden future.&nbsp; It was required that the spectator should
concentrate all his attention on the glass, and, on the principle that they
who gazed long should not gaze in vain, he obtained the desired
glimpse.&nbsp; <i>Cwrt Cadno</i>, already referred to, professed to have
such a glass.</p>
<p>But, the magician&rsquo;s glass is an instrument so often mentioned in
connection with necromancy in all parts of the world, that more need not be
said of it.</p>
<p>I will now give a few stories illustrative of the conjuror&rsquo;s
power.</p>
<h3>A Conjuror&rsquo;s Punishment of an Innkeeper for his exorbitant
charges.</h3>
<p>A famous conjuror, Dick Spot, was on his way to Llanrwst, and he turned
into a public house at Henllan for refreshments.&nbsp; He called for a
glass of beer and bread and cheese, and was charged tenpence for the same,
fourpence for the beer, and sixpence for the bread and cheese.&nbsp; This
charge he considered outrageous, but he paid the demand, and before
departing he took a scrap of paper and wrote on it a spell, and hid it
under the table, and then went on his way.&nbsp; That evening, soon after
the landlord and landlady had retired for the night, leaving the servant
girl to clear up, they were surprised to hear in the kitchen an
unaccountable noise; shouting and jumping was the order of the day, or
rather night, in that room.&nbsp; The good people heard the girl shout at
the top of her voice&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Six and four are ten,<br />
Count it o&rsquo;er again,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>and then she danced like mad round and round the kitchen.&nbsp;
They sternly requested the girl to cease yelling, and to come to bed, but
the only answer they received was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Six and four are ten,<br />
Count it o&rsquo;er again,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and with accelerated speed she danced round and round the kitchen.</p>
<p>The thought now struck the landlord that the girl had gone out of her
mind, and so he got up, and went to see what was the matter with her, with
the intention of trying to get her away from the kitchen.&nbsp; But the
moment he placed his foot in the kitchen, he gave a jump, and joined the
girl in her mad dance, and with her he shrieked out&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Six and four are ten,<br />
Count it o&rsquo;er again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now the noise was doubled, and the good wife, finding that her
husband did not return to her, became very angry, if not jealous.&nbsp; She
shouted to them to cease their row, but all to no purpose, for the dancing
and the shouting continued.&nbsp; Then she left her bed and went to the
kitchen door, and greatly disgusted she was to see her husband and maid
dancing together in that shameless manner.&nbsp; She stood at the door a
moment or two observing their frantic behaviour, and then she determined
forcibly to put a stop to the proceedings, so into the room she bounded,
but with a hop and a jump she joined in the dance, and sang out in chorus
with the other two&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Six and four are ten,<br />
Count it o&rsquo;er again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The uproar now was great indeed, and roused the neighbours from their
sleep.&nbsp; They from outside heard the mad dance and the words, and
guessed that Dick Spot had been the cause of all this.&nbsp; One of those
present hurried after the conjuror, who, fortunately, was close at hand,
and desired <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>him to return to the inn to release the people from his
spell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;take the piece of paper
that is under the table and burn it, and they will then stop their
row.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man returned to the inn, pushed open the door, rushed
to the table, and cast the paper into the fire, and then the trio became
quiet.&nbsp; But they had nearly exhausted themselves by their severe
exertions ere they were released from the power of the spell.</p>
<h3>A Conjuror and Robbers.</h3>
<p>A conjuror, or <i>Gwr Cyfarwydd</i>, was travelling over the
Denbighshire hills to Carnarvonshire; being weary, he entered a house that
he saw on his way, and he requested refreshments, which were given him by a
young woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must make haste
and depart, for my brothers will soon be here, and they are desperate men,
and they will kill you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no, the stranger was in no hurry
to move on, and though repeatedly besought to depart, he would not do
so.&nbsp; To the great dread and fear of the young woman, her brothers came
in, and, in anger at finding a stranger there, bade him prepare for
death.&nbsp; He requested a few minutes&rsquo; respite, and took out a book
and commenced reading it.&nbsp; When he was thus engaged a horn began
growing in the centre of the table, and on this the robbers were obliged to
gaze, and they were unable even to move.&nbsp; The stranger went to bed,
and found the robbers in the morning still gazing at the horn, as he knew
they would be, and he departed leaving them thus engaged, and the tale
goes, that they were arrested in that position, being unable to offer any
resistance to their captors.</p>
<p>There are several versions of the Horn Tale afloat; instead of being
made to grow out of a table, it was made to grow out of a person&rsquo;s
head or forehead.&nbsp; There is a tradition <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>that Huw Llwyd was
able to do this wonderful thing, and that he actually did it.</p>
<h3>The Conjuror and the Cattle.</h3>
<p>R. H., a farmer in Llansilin parish, who lost several head of cattle,
sent or went to Shon Gyfarwydd, who lived in Llanbrynmair, a well-known
conjuror, for information concerning their death, and for a charm against
further loss.&nbsp; Both were obtained, and the charm worked so well that
the grateful farmer sent a letter to Shon acknowledging the benefit he had
derived from him.</p>
<p>This Shon was a great terror to thieves, for he was able to spot them
and mark them in such a way that they were known to be culprits.&nbsp; I am
indebted to Mr. Jones, Rector of Bylchau, near Denbigh, for the three
following stories, in which the very dread of being marked by Shon was
sufficient to make the thieves restore the stolen property.</p>
<h3>Stolen property discovered through fear of applying to the
Llanbrynmair Conjuror.</h3>
<p>Richard Thomas, Post Office, Llangadfan, lost a coat and waistcoat, and
he suspected a certain man of having stolen them.&nbsp; One day this man
came to the shop, and Thomas saw him there, and, speaking to his wife from
the kitchen in a loud voice, so as to be heard by his customer in the shop,
he said that he wanted the loan of a horse to go to Llanbrynmair.&nbsp;
Llanbrynmair was, as we know, the conjuror&rsquo;s place of abode.&nbsp;
Thomas, however, did not leave his house, nor did he intend doing so, but
that very night the stolen property was returned, and it was found the next
morning on the door sill.</p>
<h3>Reclaiming stolen property through fear of the Conjuror.</h3>
<p>A mason engaged in the restoration of Garthbeibio Church placed a trowel
for safety underneath a stone, but by morning it was gone.&nbsp; Casually
in the evening he informed <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>his fellow workmen that he had lost his
trowel, and that someone must have stolen it, but that he was determined to
find out the thief by taking a journey to Llanbrynmair.&nbsp; He never
went, but the ruse was successful, for the next morning he found, as he
suspected would be the case, the trowel underneath the very stone where he
had himself placed it.</p>
<h3>Another similar Tale.</h3>
<p>Thirty pounds were stolen from Glan-yr-afon, Garthbeibio.&nbsp; The
owner made known to his household that he intended going to Shon the
conjuror, to ascertain who had taken his money, but the next day the money
was discovered, being restored, as was believed, by the thief the night
before.</p>
<p>These stories show that the ignorant and superstitious were influenced
through fear, to restore what they had wrongfully appropriated, and their
faith in the conjuror&rsquo;s power thus resulted, in some degree, in good
to the community.&nbsp; The <i>Dyn Hyspys</i> was feared where no one else
was feared, and in this way the supposed conjuror was not altogether an
unimportant nor unnecessary member of society.&nbsp; At a time,
particularly when people are in a low state of civilization, or when they
still cling to the pagan faith of their forefathers, transmitted to them
from remote ages, then something can be procured for the good of a
benighted people even through the medium of the <i>Gwr Cyfarwydd</i>.</p>
<p>Events occurred occasionally by a strange coincidence through which the
fame of the <i>Dyn Hyspys</i> became greatly increased.&nbsp; An event of
this kind is related by Mr. Edward Hamer.&nbsp; He states that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Two respectable farmers, living in the upper Vale of the Severn
(Cwm Glyn Hafren), and standing in relationship to each other of uncle and
nephew, a few years ago <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>purchased each a pig of the same litter, from
another farmer.&nbsp; When bought, both animals were, to all appearance, in
excellent health and condition, and for a short time after their removal to
their new homes both continued to improve daily.&nbsp; It was not long,
however, before both were taken ill very suddenly.&nbsp; As there appeared
something very strange in the behaviour of his animal, the nephew firmly
believed that he was &lsquo;witched,&rsquo; and acting upon this belief,
set out for the neighbouring conjuror.&nbsp; Having received certain
injunctions from the &lsquo;wise man,&rsquo; he returned home, carried them
out, and had the satisfaction of witnessing the gradual recovery of his
pig.&nbsp; The uncle paid no attention to the persuasions and even
entreaties of his nephew; he would not believe that his pig was
&lsquo;witched,&rsquo; and refused to consult the conjuror.&nbsp; The pig
died after an illness of three weeks; <i>and many thought the owner
deserved little sympathy for manifesting so much obstinacy and
scepticism</i>.&nbsp; These events occurred in the spring of the year 1870,
and were much talked of at the time.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Montgomeryshire
Collections</i>, vol. x., p. 240.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conjurors retained their repute by much knavery and collusion with
others.</p>
<p>Tales are not wanted that expose their impostures.&nbsp; The Rev.
Meredith Hamer, late of Berse, told me of the following exposure of a
conjuror.&nbsp; I know not where the event occurred, but it is a typical
case.</p>
<h3>A Conjuror&rsquo;s Collusion exposed.</h3>
<p>This man&rsquo;s house consisted of but few rooms.&nbsp; Between the
kitchen and his study, or consulting room, was a slight partition.&nbsp; He
had a servant girl, whom he admitted as a partner in his trade.&nbsp; This
girl, when she saw a patient approach the house, which she was able to do,
because there was only one approach to it, and only one entrance, <!-- page
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>informed her
master of the fact that someone was coming, and he immediately disappeared,
and he placed himself in a position to hear the conversation of the girl
with the person who had come to consult him.&nbsp; The servant by
questioning the party adroitly obtained that information respecting the
case which her master required, and when she had obtained the necessary
information, he would appear, and forthwith tell the stranger that he knew
hours before, or days ago, that he was to have the visit now paid him, and
then he would relate all the particulars which he had himself heard through
the partition, to the amazement of the stranger, who was ignorant of this
means of communication.</p>
<p>At other times, if a person who wished to consult him came to the house
when the conjuror was in the kitchen, he would disappear as before, stating
that he was going to consult his books, and then his faithful helper would
proceed to extort the necessary information from the visitor.&nbsp; On
this, he would re-appear and exhibit his wonderful knowledge to the amazed
dupe.</p>
<p>On one occasion, though, a knowing one came to the conjuror with his arm
in a sling, and forthwith the wise man disappeared, leaving the maid to
conduct the necessary preliminary examination, and her visitor minutely
described how the accident had occurred, and how he had broken his arm in
two places, etc.</p>
<p>All this the conjuror heard, and he came into the room and rehearsed all
that he had heard; but the biter was bitten, for the stranger, taking his
broken arm out of the sling, in no very polite language accused the
conjuror of being an impostor, and pointed out the way in which the
collusion had been carried out between him and his maid.</p>
<p>This was an exposure the conjuror had not foreseen!</p>

262</span><i>The Conjuror&rsquo;s Dress</i>.</h3>
<p>Conjurors, when engaged in their uncanny work, usually wore a grotesque
dress and stood within a circle of protection.&nbsp; I find so graphic a
description of a doctor who dealt in divination in Mr. Hancock&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant&rdquo; that I will transcribe
it:&mdash;&ldquo;He&rdquo; (the raiser of the devils) &ldquo;was much
resorted to by the friends of parties mentally deranged, many of whom he
cured.&nbsp; Whenever he assumed to practise the &lsquo;black art,&rsquo;
he put on a most grotesque dress, a cap of sheepskin with a high crown,
bearing a plume of pigeons&rsquo; feathers, and a coat of unusual pattern,
with broad hems, and covered with talismanic characters.&nbsp; In his hand
he had a whip, the thong of which was made of the skin of an eel, and the
handle of bone.&nbsp; With this he drew a circle around him, outside of
which, at a proper distance, he kept those persons who came to him, whilst
he went through his mystic sentences and
performances.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Montgomeryshire Collections</i>, vol. vi, pp.
329-30.</p>
<h2>CHARMS.</h2>
<p>The cure of diseases by charms is generally supposed to be a kind of
superstition antagonistic to common sense, and yet there are undoubted
cases of complete cures through the instrumentality of charms.&nbsp; Warts
are, undoubtedly, removed by the faith of those persons who suffer from
them in the power of the charmer and his charms.&nbsp; The writer has had
innumerable instances of the efficacy of wart charms, but it is not his
intention to endeavour to trace the effect of charms on highly sensitive
people, but only to record those charms that he has seen or heard of as
having been used.</p>
<h3>Swyno&rsquo;r &rsquo;Ryri (Charming the Shingles).</h3>
<p>The shingles is a skin disease, which encircles the body like a girdle,
and the belief was that if it did so the patient died.&nbsp; However, there
was a charm for procuring <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>its removal, which was generally resorted to
with success; but the last person who could charm this disease in
Montgomeryshire lies buried on the west side of the church at Penybontfawr,
and consequently there is no one now in those parts able to charm the
shingles.&nbsp; The inscription on his tombstone informs us that Robert
Davies, Glanhafon Fawr, died March 13th, 1864, aged 29, so that faith in
this charm has reached our days.</p>
<p>It was believed that the descendants of a person who had eaten
eagle&rsquo;s flesh <i>to the ninth generation</i> could charm for
shingles.</p>
<p>The manner of proceeding can be seen from the following quotation taken
from &ldquo;The History of Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant,&rdquo; by Mr. T. W.
Hancock, which appears in vol. vi., pp. 327-8 of the <i>Montgomeryshire
Collections</i>.</p>
<h3>A Charm for the Shingles.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This custom (charming for the shingles) was more prevalent in
this parish than in any other in Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; A certain amount of
penance was to be done by the sufferer, who was to go to the charmer in the
morning fasting, and he was also to be fasting.&nbsp; The mode of cure was
simple&mdash;the charmer breathed gently on the inflamed part, and then
followed a series of little spittings upon and around it.&nbsp; A few
visits to the charmer, or sometimes a single one, was sufficient to effect
a cure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power of charming for the &lsquo;&rsquo;Ryri&rsquo; is now
lost, or in any event has not been practised in this parish, for several
years past.&nbsp; The possession of this remarkable healing power by the
charmer was said to have been derived from the circumstance <i>of either
the charmer himself</i>, <i>or one of his ancestors within the ninth
degree</i>, <i>having eaten of the flesh of the eagle</i>, the virtue
being, it was alleged, transmitted from the person who had so partaken to
his descendants <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>for nine generations.&nbsp; The tradition is
that the disorder was introduced into the country by a malevolent
eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some charmers before the operation of spitting, muttered to
themselves the following incantation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yr Eryr Eryres<br />
Mi a&rsquo;th ddanfonais<br />
Dros naw m&ocirc;r a thros naw mynydd,<br />
A thros naw erw o dir anghelfydd;<br />
Lle na chyfartho ci, ac na frefo fuwch,<br />
Ac na ddelo yr eryr byth yn uwch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Male eagle, female eagle,<br />
I send you (by the operation of blowing, we presume)<br />
Over nine seas, and over nine mountains,<br />
And over nine acres of unprofitable land,<br />
Where no dog shall bark, and no cow shall low,<br />
And where no eagle shall higher rise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The charmer spat first on the rash and rubbed it with his finger over
the affected parts, and then breathed nine times on it.</p>
<p>Jane Davies, an aged woman, a native of Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant, with
whom I had many long conversations on several occasions, told the narrator
that she had cut a cat&rsquo;s ear to get blood, wherewith to rub the
patient&rsquo;s breast who was suffering from the shingles, to stop its
progress, until the sufferer could be visited by the charmer, and she said
that the cat&rsquo;s blood always stopped it spreading.</p>
<p>There were several charms for many of the ailments to which man is
subject, which were thought to possess equal curative virtues.</p>
<h3>Toothache charms.</h3>
<p>By repeating the following doggerel lines the worst case of toothache
could be cured&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter sat on a marble stone,<br />
Jesus came to him all alone.<br />
What&rsquo;s up, Peter?&nbsp; The toothache, my lord;<br />
Rise up Peter, and be cured of this pain,<br />
And all those <i>who carry these few lines</i> for my sake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>This charm appeared in the <i>Wrexham Advertiser</i> as one that
was used in <i>Coedpoeth</i> and <i>Bwlch Gwyn</i>.&nbsp; But the words
appear in &ldquo;<i>Y Gwyliedydd</i>&rdquo; for May, 1826, page 151.&nbsp;
The Welsh heading to the charm informs us that it was obtained from an
Irish priest in County Cork, Ireland.&nbsp; The words are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fel yr oedd Pedr yn eistedd ar faen Mynor,<br />
Crist a ddaeth atto, ac efe yn unig.<br />
Pedr, beth a ddarfu i ti?&nbsp; Y Ddanodd, fy Arglwydd Dduw.<br />
Cyfod, Pedr, a rhydd fyddi;<br />
A bydd pob dyn a dynes iach oddiwrth y ddanodd<br />
Y rhai a gredant i&rsquo;r geiriau hyn,<br />
Yr wyf fi yn gwneuthur yn enw Duw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two lines of the English and Welsh are the same but the third
and succeeding lines in Welsh are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter, what is the matter?<br />
The toothache, my Lord God.<br />
Rise Peter, and thou shalt be cured;<br />
And every man and woman who believes these words<br />
Shall be cured of the toothache,<br />
Which I perform in the name of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another version of this charm was given me by Mrs. Reynolds, Pembroke
House, Oswestry&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Jesus walked through the gates of Jerusalem,<br />
He saw Peter weeping.&nbsp; Jesus said unto him, why weepest thou?<br />
I have got the toothache.&nbsp; Jesus touched his tooth,<br />
And Jesus said, have faith and believe,<br />
Thy tooth shall ache no more.<br />
I return you humble and hearty thanks<br />
For the blessing which you have bestowed on me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A young man told me that his brother once suffered greatly from
toothache, and a woman gave him a charm like the above, written on
paper.&nbsp; He rubbed the charm along the tooth, and he kept it in his
pocket until it crumbled away, and as long as he preserved it he never was
troubled with the toothache.</p>
<h3><!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span><i>Rosemary Charm for Toothache</i>.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Llosg ei bren (Rhosmari) hyd oni bo yn lo du, ac yna dyro ef mewn
cadach lliain cry, ac ira dy ddanedd ag ef; ac fo ladd y pryfed, ac
a&rsquo;u ceidw rhag pob clefyd.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Y Brython</i>, p. 339.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn a Rosemary bough until it becomes black, and then place it
in a strong linen cloth, and anoint thy teeth with it, and it will kill the
worm, and preserve thee from every kind of fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thought at one time that toothache was caused by a worm in the
tooth, as intimated above.</p>
<h3>Whooping Cough Charm.</h3>
<p>Children suffering from whooping cough were taken to a seventh son, or
lacking a seventh son of sons only, to a fifth son of sons only, who made a
cake, and gave it to the sufferers to be eaten by them, and they would
recover.&nbsp; The visit was to be thrice repeated.&nbsp; Bread and butter
were sometimes substituted for the cake.</p>
<p>The writer has been told of instances of the success of this charm.</p>
<p>Another charm was&mdash;buy a penny roll, wrap it in calico, bury it in
the garden, take it up next day.&nbsp; The sufferer from whooping-cough is
then to eat the roll until it is consumed.</p>
<h3>Charm for Fits.</h3>
<p>A ring made out of the offertory money was a cure for fits.&nbsp; About
the year 1882 the wife of a respectable farmer in the parish of Efenechtyd
called at the rectory and asked the rector&rsquo;s wife if she would
procure a shilling for her from the offering made at Holy Communion, out of
which she was going to have a ring made to cure her fits.&nbsp; This coin
was to be given unsolicited and received without thanks.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. D. Edwards, late vicar of Rhosymedre, informed the writer
that his parishioners often obtained silver <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>coins from the
offertory for the purpose now named.&nbsp; So as to comply with the
conditions, the sufferers went to Mrs. Edwards some time during the week
before &ldquo;Sacrament Sunday,&rdquo; and asked her to request Mr. Edwards
to give him or her a shilling out of the offertory, and on the following
Monday the afflicted person would be at the Vicarage, and the Vicar, having
already been instructed by Mrs. Edwards, gave the shilling without uttering
a word, and it was received in the same manner.</p>
<p>Another charm for fits was to procure a human being&rsquo;s skull, grind
it into powder, and take it as medicine.</p>
<h3>Charm for Cocks about to fight.</h3>
<p>The charm consisted of a verse taken from the Bible, written on a slip
of paper, wrapped round the bird&rsquo;s leg, as the steel spurs were being
placed on him.&nbsp; The verse so employed was, Eph. vi.,
16:&mdash;&ldquo;Taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Jones, Pentre Llyffrith, Llanfyllin, was a celebrated cock
charmer.&nbsp; There was also a well-known charmer who lived at Llandegla,
Denbighshire, who refused a charm to a certain man.&nbsp; When asked why he
had not complied with his request, he said&mdash;&ldquo;He will not need
charms for his birds, for he will be a dead man before the main comes
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; This became true, for the man died, as foretold.</p>
<h3>Charm for Asthma.</h3>
<p>Place the Bible for three successive nights under the bolster of the
sufferer, and it will cure him.</p>
<h3>Charms for Warts.</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; Drop a pin into a holy well and your warts will disappear, but
should anyone take the pin out of the well, the warts you have lost will
grow on his fingers.</p>
<p><!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>2.&nbsp; Rub the warts with the inside of a bean pod, and then
throw the pod away.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Take wheat on the stalk, rub the warts with the wheat&rsquo;s
beard or bristles at the end of the ear, take these to four crosses or
roads that cross each other, bury the straw, and the warts will decay with
the decay of the straw.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Rub the warts with elderberry leaves plucked by night, and then
burn them, and the warts will disappear.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Rub the warts with a bit of flesh meat, wrap the flesh up in
paper, throw it behind your back, and do not look behind you to see what
becomes of it, and whoever picks it up gets your warts.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Take a snail and pierce it through with a thorn, and leave it
to die on the bush; as it disappears so will your warts.</p>
<h3>Charm for removing a Stye from the eye.</h3>
<p>Take an ordinary knitting needle, and pass it back and fore over the
stye, but without touching it, and at the same time counting its age,
thus&mdash;One stye, two styes, three styes, up to nine, and then reversing
the order, as nine styes, eight styes, down to one stye, and <i>no</i>
stye.&nbsp; This counting was to be done in one breath.&nbsp; If the
charmer drew his breath the charm was broken, but three attempts were
allowed.&nbsp; The stye, it was alleged, would die from that hour, and
disappear in twenty-four hours.</p>
<h3>Charms for Quinsy.</h3>
<p>Apply to the throat hair cut at midnight from the black shoulder stripe
of the colt of an ass.</p>
<h3>Charming the Wild Wart.</h3>
<p>Take a branch of elder tree, strip off the bark, split off a piece, hold
this skewer near the wart, and rub the wart three or nine times with the
skewer, muttering the while an incantation of your own composing, then
pierce the wart <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>with a thorn.&nbsp; Bury the skewer transfixed
with the thorn in a dunghill.&nbsp; The wart will rot away just as the
buried things decay.</p>
<h3>Charm for Rheumatism.</h3>
<p>Carry a potato in your pocket, and when one is finished, supply its
place with another.</p>
<h3>Charm for removing the Ringworm.</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; Spit on the ground the first thing in the morning, mix the
spittle with the mould, and then anoint the ringworm with this mixture.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Hold an axe over the fire until it perspires, and then anoint
the ringworm with the sweat.</p>
<h3>Cattle Charms.</h3>
<p>Mr. Hamer in his &ldquo;Parochial Account of Llanidloes&rdquo; published
in <i>The Montgomeryshire Collections</i>, vol x., p. 249, states that he
has in his possession two charms that were actually used for the protection
of live stock of two small farms.&nbsp; One of them opens thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; Amen . . . and in the name of Lord Jesus Christ my redeemer,
that I will give relief to --- creatures his cows, and his calves, and his
horses, and his sheep, and his pigs, and all creatures that alive be in his
possession, from all witchcraft and from all other assaults of Satan.&nbsp;
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hamer further states that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the bottom of the sheet, on the left, is the magical word,
<i>Abracadabra</i>, written in the usual triangular form; in the centre, a
number of planetary symbols, and on the right, a circular figure filled in
with lines and symbols, and beneath them the words, &lsquo;By Jah, Joh,
Jab.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was the custom to rub these charms over the cattle,
etc. a number of times, while some incantation was being mumbled.&nbsp; The
<!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>paper was then carefully folded up, and put in some safe place
where the animals were housed, as a guard against future
visitations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other cases the charm was worn by the cattle, as is shown by the
following tale:&mdash;</p>
<h3>Charm against Foot and Mouth Disease.</h3>
<p>The cattle on a certain farm in Llansilin parish suffered from the above
complaint, and old Mr. H--- consulted a conjuror, who gave him a written
charm which he was directed to place on the horns of the cattle, and he was
told this would act both as a preventive and a cure.&nbsp; This
farmer&rsquo;s cattle might be seen with the bit of paper, thus procured,
tied to their horns.&nbsp; My informant does not wish to be named, nor does
she desire the farmer&rsquo;s name to be given, but she vouches for the
accuracy of her information, and for my own use, she gave me all
particulars respecting the above.&nbsp; This took place only a few years
ago, when the Foot and Mouth Disease first visited Wales.</p>
<p>I obtained, through the kindness of the Rev. John Davies, vicar of
Bryneglwys, the following charm procured from Mr. R. Jones, Tynywern,
Bryneglwys, Denbighshire, who had it from his uncle, by whom it was used at
one time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Yn enw y Tad</i>, <i>a&rsquo;r Mab</i>, <i>a&rsquo;r Ysbryd</i>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It was somewhat difficult to decipher the charms and four words towards
the end are quite illegible, and consequently they are omitted.&nbsp; The
following translation will show the nature of the charm:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In the Name of the Father</i>, <i>the Son</i>, <i>and the
Spirit</i>.</p>
<p>May Christ Jesus the sanctified one, who suffered death on the cross,<br
/>
When thou didst raise Lazarus from his tomb after his death,<br />
When Thou forgavest sins to Mary Magdalen, have<br />
mercy on me, so that everything named by me and<br />
crossed by me ++++ may be saved by the power and<br />
virtue of thy blessed words my Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.<br />
Jesus Christ our Lord save us from every kind of<br />
temptation whether spiritual above the earth or<br />
under the earth, from the devilish man or woman<br />
with evil heart who bewitcheth the goods of their<br />
owner; his evil virtue, his evil excommunicated heart<br />
cut off from the Catholic Faith ++++ by the power<br />
and virtue of thy blessed words my Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.<br />
Jesus Christ our Lord save us from the disease and the<br />
affliction, and the wrath, and the envy, and the<br />
mischief, and the . . . and the planet of the sky<br />
and the earthly poison, by the power and virtue<br />
of Thy blessed words, my Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mark ++++ indicates that crosses were here made by the person who
used the charm, and probably the words of the charm were audibly
uttered.</p>
<h3><!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span><i>Another Cattle Charm Spell</i>.</h3>
<p>Mr. Hughes, Plasnewydd, Llansilin, lost several head of cattle.&nbsp; He
was told to bleed one of the herd, boil the blood, and take it to the
cowhouse at midnight.&nbsp; He did so, and lost no more after applying this
charm.</p>
<h3>A Charm for Calves.</h3>
<p>If calves were scoured over much, and in danger of dying, a hazel twig
the length of the calf was twisted round the neck like a collar, and it was
supposed to cure them.</p>
<h3>A Charm for Stopping Bleeding.</h3>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds, whom I have already mentioned in connection with a charm
for toothache, gave me the following charm.&nbsp; It bears date April 5,
1842:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ was born at Bethlehem,<br />
By the Virgin Mary,<br />
Baptized in the River Jordan,<br />
By St. John the Baptist.<br />
He commanded the water to stop, and it obeyed Him.<br />
And I desire in the name of Jesus Christ,<br />
That the blood of this vein (or veins) might stop,<br />
As the water did when Jesus Christ was baptized.</p>

<h3>Charm to make a Servant reliable.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Y neb a fyno gael ei weinidog yn gywir, doded beth o&rsquo;r
lludw hwn yn nillad ei weinidog ac efe a fydd cywir tra parhao&rsquo;r

<p>Which is:&mdash;Whosoever wishes to make his servant faithful let him
place the ashes (of a snake) in the clothes of his servant, and as long as
they remain there he will be faithful.</p>
<p>There are many other wonderful things to be accomplished with the skin
of an adder, or snake, besides the preceding.&nbsp; The following are
recorded in <i>Y Brython</i>, vol. iii., p. 137.</p>
<h3><!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span><i>Charms performed with Snake&rsquo;s Skin</i>.</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; Burn the skin and preserve the ashes.&nbsp; A little salve made
out of the ashes will heal a wound.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A little of the ashes placed between the shoulders will make a
man invulnerable.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Whoso places a little of the ashes in the water with which he
washes himself, should his enemies meet him, they will flee because of the
beauty of his face.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Cast a little of the ashes into thy neighbour&rsquo;s house,
and he will leave it.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Place the ashes under the sole of thy foot, and everybody will
agree with thee.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Should a man wrestle, let him place some of the ashes under his
tongue, and no one can conquer him.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Should a man wish to know what is about to occur to him, let
him place a pinch of the ashes on his head, and then go to sleep, and his
dreams will reveal the future.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Should a person wish to ascertain the mind of another, let him
throw a little of the ashes on that person&rsquo;s clothes, and then let
him ask what he likes, the answer will be true.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Has already been given above.&nbsp; (See page 272).</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; If a person is afraid of being poisoned in his food, let him
place the ashes on the table with his food, and poison cannot stay there
with the ashes.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; If a person wishes to succeed in love, let him wash his hands
and keep some of the ashes in them, and then everybody will love him.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; The skin of the adder is a remedy against fevers.</p>
<h3>The Charms performed with Rosemary.</h3>
<p>Rosemary dried in the sun and made into powder, tied in a cloth around
the right arm, will make the sick well.</p>
<p>The smoke of rosemary bark, sniffed, will, even if you are in gaol,
release you.</p>
<p><!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>The leaves made into salve, placed on a wound, where the flesh is
dead, will cure the wound.</p>
<p>A spoon made out of its wood will make whatever you eat therewith
nutritious.</p>
<p>Place it under the door post, and no snake nor adder can ever enter thy
house.</p>
<p>The leaves placed in beer or wine will keep these liquids from becoming
sour, and give them such a flavour that you will dispose of them
quickly.</p>
<p>Place a branch of rosemary on the barrel, and it will keep thee from
fever, even though thou drink of it for a whole day.</p>
<p>Such were some of the wonderful virtues of this plant, as given in the
<i>Brython</i>, vol. iii., p. 339.</p>
<h3>Charm for Clefyd y Galon, or Heart Disease.</h3>
<p>The Rev. J. Felix, vicar of Cilcen, near Mold, when a young man lodged
in Eglwysfach, near Glandovey.&nbsp; His landlady, noticing that he looked
pale and thin, suggested that he was suffering from Clefyd y galon, which
may be translated as above, or love sickness, a complaint common enough
among young people, and she suggested that he should call in David Jenkins,
a respectable farmer and a local preacher with the Wesleyans, to cure
him.&nbsp; Jenkins came, and asked the supposed sufferer whether he
believed in charms, and was answered in the negative.&nbsp; However, he
proceeded with his patient as if he had answered in the affirmative.&nbsp;
Mr Felix was told to take his coat off, he did so, and then he was bidden
to tuck up his shirt above his elbow.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Jenkins then took a
yarn thread and placing one end on the elbow measured to the tip of
Felix&rsquo;s middle finger, then he told his patient to take hold of the
yarn at one end, the other end resting the while on the elbow, and he was
to take fast hold of it, and stretch it.&nbsp; This he did, and <!-- page
275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>the yarn
lengthened, and this was a sign that he was actually sick of heart
disease.&nbsp; Then the charmer tied this yarn around the patient&rsquo;s
left arm above the elbow, and there it was left, and on the next visit
measured again, and he was pronounced cured.</p>
<p>The above information I received from Mr. Felix, who is still alive and
well.</p>
<p>There were various ways of proceeding in this charm.&nbsp; Yarn was
always used and the measurement as above made, and sometimes the person was
named and his age, and the Trinity was invoked, then the thread was put
around the neck of the sick person, and left there for three nights, and
afterwards buried in the name of the Trinity under ashes.&nbsp; If the
thread shortened above the second joint of the middle finger there was
little hope of recovery; should it lengthen that was a sign of
recovery.</p>
<h3>Clefyd yr Ede Wlan or Yarn Sickness.</h3>
<p>About twenty years ago, when the writer was curate of Llanwnog,
Montgomeryshire, a young Welsh married woman came to reside in the parish
suffering from what appeared to be that fell disease, consumption.&nbsp; He
visited her in her illness, and one day she appeared much elated as she had
been told that she was improving in health.&nbsp; She told the narrator
that she was suffering from <i>Clwyf yr ede wlan</i> or the woollen thread
sickness, and she said that the yarn had <i>lengthened</i>, which was a
sign that she was recovering.&nbsp; The charm was the same as that
mentioned above, supplemented with a drink made of a quart of old beer,
into which a piece of heated steel had been dipped, with an ounce of meadow
saffron tied up in muslin soaked in it, taken in doses daily of a certain
prescribed quantity, and the thread was measured daily, thrice I believe,
to see if she was being cured or the reverse.&nbsp; Should the yarn shorten
it was a sign <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>of death, if it lengthened it indicated a
recovery.&nbsp; However, although the yarn in this case lengthened, the
young woman died.&nbsp; The charm failed.</p>
<p>Sufficient has been said about charms to show how prevalent faith in
their efficiency was.&nbsp; Ailments of all descriptions had their
accompanying antidotes; but it is singularly strange that people professing
the Christian religion should cling so tenaciously to paganism and its
forms, so that even in our own days, such absurdities as charms find a
resting-place in the minds of our rustic population, and often, even the
better-educated classes resort to charms for obtaining cures for themselves
and their animals.</p>
<p>But from ancient times, omens, charms, and auguries have held
considerable sway over the destinies of men.&nbsp; That charming book,
<i>Plutarch&rsquo;s Lives</i>, abounds with instances of this kind.&nbsp;
Indeed, an excellent collection of ancient Folk-lore could easily be
compiled from extant classical authors.&nbsp; Most things die hard, and
ideas that have once made a lodgment in the mind of man, particularly when
they are connected in any way with his faith, die the very hardest of
all.&nbsp; Thus it is that such beliefs as are treated of in this chapter
still exist, and they have reached our days from distant periods, filtered
somewhat in their transit, but still retaining their primitive
qualities.</p>
<p>We have not as yet gathered together the fragments of the ancient
religion of the Celts, and formed of them a consistent whole, but evidently
we are to look for them in the sayings and doings of the people quite as
much as in the writings of the ancients.&nbsp; If we could only ascertain
what views were held respecting any particular matter in ancient times, we
might undoubtedly find traces of them even in modern days.&nbsp; Let us
take for instance only one subject, and see whether traces of it still
exist.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar in his <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span><i>Commentaries</i> states of the Druids that,
&ldquo;One of their principal maxims is that the soul never dies, but that
after death it passes into the body of another being.&nbsp; This maxim they
consider to be of the greatest utility to encourage virtue and to make them
regardless of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, is there anything that can be associated with such teaching still
to be found?&nbsp; The various tales previously given of hags turning
themselves and others into various kinds of animals prove that people
believed that such transitions were in life possible, and they had only to
go a step further and apply the same faith to the soul, and we arrive at
the transmigration of souls.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to make too much of the following tale, for it
may be only a shred, but still as such it is worthy of record.&nbsp; A few
years ago I was staying at the Rectory, Erbistock, near Ruabon, and the
rector, the Rev. P. W. Sparling, in course of conversation, said that a
parishioner, one Betsy Roberts, told him that she knew before anyone told
her, that a certain person died at such and such a time.&nbsp; The rector
asked her how she came to know of the death if no one had informed her, and
if she had not been to the house to ascertain the fact.&nbsp; Her answer
was, &ldquo;I knew because I saw a hare come from towards his house and
cross over the road before me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was about all that the
rector could elicit, but evidently the woman connected the appearance of
the hare with the death of the man.&nbsp; The association of the live hare
with the dead man was here a fact, and possibly in the birthplace of that
woman such a connection of ideas was common.&nbsp; Furthermore, it has
often been told me by people who have professed to have heard what they
related, that being present in the death chamber of a friend they have
heard a bird singing beautifully outside in the darkness, and that it
stopped immediately <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>on the death of their friend.&nbsp; Here again
we have a strange connection between two forms of life, and can this be a
lingering Druidic or other ancient faith?</p>
<p>In the <i>Dictionary of the Welsh Language</i> by the Rev. Canon Silvan
Evans, part i., p. 8, under the word <i>Abred</i>, we have an exhaustive
statement on the subject of transmigration, which I will take the liberty
to transcribe, for it certainly throws light on the matter now treated
of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Abred</i> . . .&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; The state or condition through
which, by a regular upward gradation, all animated beings pass from the
lowest point of existence in which they originate, towards humanity and the
highest state of happiness and perfection.&nbsp; All the states of
animation below that of humanity are necessarily evil; in the state of
humanity, good and evil are equally balanced; and in all the states above
humanity, good preponderates and evil becomes impossible.&nbsp; If man, as
a free agent, attaches himself to evil, he falls in death into such an
animal state of existence as corresponds with the turpitude of his soul,
which may be so great as to cast him down into the lowest point of
existence, from which he shall again return through such a succession of
animal existences as is most proper to divest him of his evil
propensities.&nbsp; After traversing such a course, he will again rise to
the probationary state of humanity, where according to contingencies he may
rise or fall; yet, should he fall, he shall rise again, and should this
happen for millions of ages, the path of happiness is still open to him,
and will so remain to all eternity, for sooner or later he will infallibly
arrive at his destined station or happiness, from which he can never
fall.&nbsp; This doctrine of metamorphosis or evolution, attributed to the
Druids and the Welsh bards, is succinctly but fully stated by its
hierophant, Iolo Morganwg, in his &lsquo;Poems&rsquo; (1794), ii., 195-256,
<!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>and elucidated by documents which had not previously been made
public, but of which none are of an early date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus writes the Welsh lexicographer on this matter.&nbsp; The word
<i>abred</i> is archaic, as is the idea for which it stands; but as already
said, very little has been lost of ideas which were once the property of
kindred races; so here we have no exception to the general rule, though the
word <i>abred</i> and the theory it represented come down to modern times
strengthless, resembling the lifeless mummy of an Egyptian king that once
represented a living people and principle.&nbsp; Still, the word and the
idea it stands for have descended, in form, to our days, and tell us
something about the faith of our forefathers regarding the immortality of
the soul.</p>
<h2>RHAMANTA, OR OMEN SEEKING.</h2>
<p><i>Rhamanta</i> was a kind of divination that could be resorted to
without the intervention of any outside party, by anyone wishful to
ascertain the future with reference to herself or himself.&nbsp; It
differed, therefore, from the preceding tales of conjurors or witches,
insomuch that the services of neither of these parties were required by the
anxious seekers of coming events.&nbsp; They could themselves uplift the
veil, using, however, for this purpose certain means, which were credited
with possessing the power of opening to their view events which were about
to happen.</p>
<p>As there was something uncanny in this seeking for hidden information,
young women generally in companies of three sought for the information
their inquisitiveness required.&nbsp; This was usually done in the dead of
night, and twelve o&rsquo;clock was the hour when they resorted to their
incantations.&nbsp; Some of the expedients adopted were harmless, though
silly; others were cruel.&nbsp; To the effective carrying out <!-- page
280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>of the
matter it was generally necessary that at least one of the party should
have slept within the year on an oat-straw bed, or a bed made of the leaves
of mountain ash, mixed with the seeds of a spring fern, and a pillow of
Maiden Hair.</p>
<p>The nights generally resorted to for the purpose mentioned above were
All Hallow Eve, S. John&rsquo;s Eve, and Mayday Eve, but there were other
times also when the lovesick could get a glimpse of their life
partners.</p>
<p>I have said that some of the means employed were innocent and others
cruel.&nbsp; Before proceeding I will record instances of both kinds.&nbsp;
It was thought that if a young woman placed a snail under a basin on <i>Nos
Wyl Ifan</i>, S. John&rsquo;s Eve, it would by its movements trace the name
of her coming husband underneath, or at least his initials.&nbsp; One can
very well imagine a young woman not over particular as to form, being able
to decipher the snail&rsquo;s wanderings, and making them represent her
lover&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Should the snail have remained immovable during
the night, this indicated her own or her lover&rsquo;s death; or at the
least, no offer of marriage in the coming year.</p>
<p>It was usual for young women to hunt for <i>Llysiau Ifan</i> (S.
John&rsquo;s Wort) on <i>Nos Wyl Ifan</i>, at midnight, and it was thought
that the silvery light of a glow-worm would assist them in discovering the
plant.&nbsp; The first thing, therefore, was to search for their living
lanthorn.&nbsp; This found, they carried the glow-worm in the palm of the
hand, and proceeding in their search they sought underneath or among the
fern for St. John&rsquo;s Wort.&nbsp; When found, a bunch was carried away,
and hung in the young woman&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; If in the morning the
leaves appeared fresh, it was a sign that she should be married within the
year; if, however, the leaves were found hanging down or dead, this
indicated her death, or that she was not to get a husband within that
year.&nbsp; We <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>can well understand that a sharp young person
would resort to means to keep the plant alive, and thus avert what she most
feared.</p>
<p>The following instance of <i>Rhamanta</i> I received from a young woman
who witnessed the work done.&nbsp; She gave me the name of the party, but
for special reasons I do not supply names.</p>
<p>A young woman was madly in love with a young man, and she gave the
servant man a jug of beer for procuring a frog for her.&nbsp; This he did;
and she took the poor creature to the garden, and thrust several pins into
its back.&nbsp; The tortured creature writhed under the pain, but the cruel
girl did not cease until the required number had been inserted.&nbsp; Then
she placed the frog under a vessel to prevent its escape, and turning to my
informant, she said, &ldquo;There, he will now come to our house this
evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man certainly came, and when he entered she
smiled at my informant, and then both went together to the lacerated frog,
and the pins were extracted one by one from its back, and the wounded
animal was set at liberty.&nbsp; My informant said that the hard-hearted
girl mumbled something both when inserting and extracting the pins.</p>
<p>It was believed that the spirit of a person could be invoked and that it
would appear, after the performance of certain ceremonies, to the person
who was engaged in the weird undertaking.&nbsp; Thus a young woman who had
gone round the church seven times on All Hallow Eve came home to her
mistress, who was in the secret that she was going to <i>rhamanta</i>, and
said, &ldquo;Why did you send master to frighten me?&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
master had not left the house.&nbsp; His wife perceived that it was the
spirit of her husband that had appeared to the girl, and she requested the
girl to be kind to her children, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you
will soon be mistress here.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a short time <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>afterwards the wife
died, and the girl became her successor.</p>
<p>I obtained the preceding tale from the Rev. P. Edwards, son of the
Rector of Llanwyddelan, Montgomeryshire, and the lady who related the tale
of herself to Mr. Edwards said the occurrence took place when she was
servant girl.</p>
<p>There are several versions of the above tale to be met with in many
places in Wales.</p>
<p>I will give one, omitting names, from my work on &ldquo;<i>Old Stone
Crosses</i>,&rdquo; p. 203:&mdash;&ldquo;An aged woman in Gyffylliog
parish, who is still alive (1886), saw her husband by <i>rhamanta</i>; and
so did her fellow-servant.&nbsp; I am indebted to Mr. Jones, Woodland Farm,
to whom the woman related it, for the story I am about to give.&nbsp; When
young women, she and her fellow-servant, in accordance with the practice of
the country, determined to obtain a sight of the men whom they were to
marry.&nbsp; The mistress was let into the secret that that night one of
the two was going to raise the veil of the future, and the other the
following night.&nbsp; As the clock began striking twelve the
fellow-servant began striking the floor with a strap, repeating the
doggerel lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Am gyd-fydio i gyd-ffatio,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and almost immediately she saw her master come down stairs.&nbsp; The
girl innocently the next day asked her mistress why she had sent her master
down stairs to frighten her.&nbsp; The answer of her mistress was,
&lsquo;Take care of my children.&rsquo;&nbsp; This girl ultimately married
her master.&nbsp; The next night it was the other girl&rsquo;s turn, and
she saw a dark man, whom she had never seen before; but in the course of a
week or so, a stranger came into the farmyard, and she at once perceived
that it was the person whom she had seen when divining.&nbsp; Upon inquiry,
she ascertained that he was a married man, but in time his wife died, and
the girl became his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were several ways of proceeding by young girls who <!-- page
283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>were anxious
to ascertain whom they were to marry.&nbsp; One of these was by means of
yarn.&nbsp; This divination was usually performed by two young girls after
the family had retired for the night.&nbsp; It has been called <i>Coel ede
wlan</i>, or the yarn test, and under this name I will describe the
process.</p>
<h3>Coel Ede Wlan, or the Yarn Test.</h3>
<p>Two young women took a ball of yarn and doubled the threads, and then
tied tiny pieces of wood along these threads so as to form a miniature
ladder.&nbsp; Then they went upstairs together, and opening the window
threw this artificial ladder to the ground, and then the one who was
performing the incantation commenced winding the yarn back, saying the
while:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Y fi sy&rsquo;n dirwyn<br />
Pwy sy&rsquo;n dal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am winding,<br />
Who is holding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was done three times, and if no lover made his appearance, then for
that year her chances of marriage were gone.&nbsp; The next evening the
other girl in the same manner tried her fortune, and possibly better luck
would attend her trial.&nbsp; It was believed that the spirit of the coming
husband would mount this ladder and present himself to his future wife.</p>
<p>The Rev. R. Jones, rector of Llanycil, told me the following tale.&nbsp;
Two young men from Festiniog went to court two young girls in the parish of
Maentwrog, servants at a farm called Gellidywyll.&nbsp; As they were going
towards the farm one of them said, &ldquo;Let me rest awhile.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He at once seated himself on the ground, and apparently he fell asleep
immediately.&nbsp; This surprised his friend, but he was thoroughly
frightened when he saw <i>a blue light emanate</i> from his mouth, and he
attempted to awaken the man, but he failed to arouse him, he seemed as if
dead.&nbsp; However, after awhile, <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>the blue light was
seen returning, and it entered the mouth of the sleeper, and he instantly
awoke, and they proceeded together towards Gellidywyll.&nbsp; At the very
time that the man felt an irresistible inclination to sleep, his love had
used the yarn incantation, and the unconscious man during his short sleep
dreamt that he had seen his sweetheart in the window, and the girl said
that he had appeared to her at the window.&nbsp; In a few months after this
proof of true love they were married.</p>
<p>Another form of incantation was to walk around the church seven or nine
times on certain nights.&nbsp; This I will call the <i>Twca Test</i> or
<i>Knife Test</i>.&nbsp; This was a very common form of incantation.</p>
<h3>Divination with the Twca or Knife.</h3>
<p>The proceeding was as follows:&mdash;The party who wished to know whom
he, or she, was to marry, went to the church secretly and walked around it
seven times, repeating the while these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dyma&rsquo;r Twca,<br />
Lle mae&rsquo;r wain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the knife,<br />
Where&rsquo;s the sheath?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was thought that the spirit of his or her life partner would
appear to the person who held the knife, with the sheath in his or her
hand, and that it would be found that the one fitted the other
exactly.&nbsp; I have been told by a person who resorted to this test that
if the person was to become a wife, her lover would certainly appear to
her; if she was to die an old maid then a coffin would meet her.&nbsp; The
superstition is mentioned in <i>Bardd Cwsg</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fe glywai rai yn son am fyned i droi o gwmpas yr Eglwys i weled
eu cariadau, a pheth a wnaeth y catffwl ond ymddangos i&rsquo;r ynfydion yn
ei lun ei hun.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is in English:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;He heard some persons talking of going round the church to
see their sweethearts, but what did the stupid one (the devil) do, but
appear to the foolish things in his own person.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Washing Test.</h3>
<p>Another well-known and often practised form of divination was for a
young woman to take an article to wash, such as a stocking, to the
water-spout or <i>pistyll</i>, and with her she carried two pieces of wood
wherewith to strike the article which was being washed.&nbsp; She went on
her knees and commenced striking the stocking, saying the while:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Am gyd-fydio i gyd-ffatio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll live together to strike together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was thought that her future husband would then appear, take hold of
the other piece of wood, and join her in her work; should the wraith
appear, a marriage within six months followed.</p>
<h3>Troi Crysau or Clothes Drying Test.</h3>
<p>Young maidens washed linen after the household had retired, and placed
the articles by the fire to dry, and then watched to see who should come at
midnight to turn the clothes.&nbsp; In this case, again, the evil one is
said to have entered the kitchen to perform this work for the young woman,
and also it is affirmed that a coffin has, ere this, moved along through
the room, a sure prognostication that she was doomed to die single.&nbsp;
<i>Bardd Cwsg</i> mentions this practice.</p>
<p>He writes in the third part of his book, where a devil is accused in the
Parliament of Hell, thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Aeth nos <i>Ystwyll</i> ddiweddaf i
ymweled a dwy ferch ieuanc yng Nghymru <i>oedd yn troi crysau</i>, ac yn
lle denu&rsquo;r genethod i faswedd, yn rhith llanc glandeg, myned ag elor
i sobreiddio un; a myned a thrwst rhyfel at y llall mewn corwynt
uffernol.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>&ldquo;He went on the night of <i>Epiphany</i> to visit two young
girls in Wales, who were turning shirts, and, instead of enticing them to
folly, in the form of a handsome young man, he took to the one a coffin to
sober her, and to the other he appeared in a hellish whirlwind, with a
horrible noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy, however, is the young woman should the man she loves appear, for
he is to be her husband.</p>
<h3>Hemp Seed Sowing.</h3>
<p>A young married woman, a native of Denbighshire, told me that if a young
woman sowed hemp seed, the figure of her lover would appear and follow
her.&nbsp; This was to be done by night on Hallow Eve.&nbsp; I find from
<i>English Folk-Lore</i>, p. 15, that this divination is practised in
Devonshire on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Eve, and that the young woman runs
round the church repeating, without stopping, the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I sow hempseed, hempseed I sow,<br />
&nbsp;  He that loves me best<br />
Come, and after me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Sage Gathering</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A young person who went of a night to the garden, and stripped the
leaves of the sage tree, would, as the clock struck twelve, be joined by
her lover.&nbsp; This was to be done on All Hallow Eve.</p>
<h3>Pullet&rsquo;s Egg Divination.</h3>
<p>Mr. J. Roberts, Plas Einion, Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, told me the
following:&mdash;When he was a young man, he, his sister, and the servant
man, formed a company to find out by divination their future life
partners.&nbsp; They procured a pullet&rsquo;s egg, it was emptied into a
cup, to this was added flour and salt, in equal proportions, these
ingredients were mixed together, made into three small cakes, and
baked.&nbsp; They all ate one half of their cake, and the other half was
placed in their respective stockings, to be placed under their
bolsters.&nbsp; <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>They went upstairs backward, and thus to bed,
preserving the while, absolute silence.&nbsp; It was believed, he said,
that they should that night, in their dreams, if everything were carried
out properly, see their partners, who would come to their bedsides to offer
them a drink of water.</p>
<h3>The Candle and Pin Divination.</h3>
<p>The process is as follows:&mdash;A couple of young women meet, and stick
pins in a candle, and if the divination acts properly the last pin drops
out of the candle at 12 o&rsquo;clock at night, and then the future husband
of the girl to whom that pin belongs appears.</p>
<p>I must not name the lady whom I am indebted to for the following
information, but she told me that when she was a young woman, she, and her
friend, took part in this prying into the future, and exactly at 12
o&rsquo;clock her companion&rsquo;s pin fell out of the candle, and at that
very instant there was a knocking at the door, and in great fright both ran
upstairs, but the knocking continued, and her friend put her head out of
the window to enquire who was there, and my informant told me that the man
at the door became her friend&rsquo;s husband, though at the time they were
consulting the future she was desperately in love with another man.</p>
<p>There were other ways in which people could <i>Rhamant</i>.&nbsp; Enough
has been said on this subject, but there are other practices resorted to,
having much the same object in view, which I will now relate.</p>
<h3>To ascertain the condition of the Person whom you are to
Marry.</h3>
<h4><i>Water in Basin Divination</i>.</h4>
<p>Should young persons wish to know whether their husbands were to be
bachelors, or their wives spinsters, the following test was to be resorted
to:&mdash;</p>
<p>Three persons were necessary to carry out the test.&nbsp; These <!--
page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>three
young ladies were to join in the undertaking and they were to proceed as
follows:&mdash;On <i>Nos Calan Gauaf</i>, All Hallow Eve, at night, three
basins were to be placed on a table, <i>one filled with clear spring
water</i>, <i>one with muddy water</i>, <i>and the other empty</i>.&nbsp;
The young ladies in turn were led blindfolded into the room, and to the
table, and they were told to place their hands on the basins.&nbsp; She who
placed her hand on the clear spring water was to marry a bachelor, whilst
the one who touched the basin with muddy water was to wed a widower, and
should the empty basin be touched it foretold that for that person a life
of single blessedness was in store.</p>
<h4><i>Hairs of a Lover found under a Holly Tree</i>.</h4>
<p>This test is to be carried out on All Hallow Eve.&nbsp; The young person
walks backwards to a holly tree, takes a handful of grass from underneath
it, and then carries the leaves to the light, and she then sees among the
grass several hairs of her true lover.</p>
<h4><i>The Bible and Key Divination</i>.</h4>
<p>A key is taken, and placed on the 16th verse of the 1st chapter of
Ruth:&mdash;&ldquo;And Ruth said, intreat me not to leave thee, or to
return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and
where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God
my God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible is then closed with that part of the key that enters the lock
on this verse.&nbsp; The person who wishes to look into the future takes
the garter off his left leg, and then ties the Bible round with his garter,
which also passes through the loop of the key.&nbsp; He has with him a
friend who joins in carrying out the test.&nbsp; Both men place one of
their big or central fingers on the key underneath the loop, and press the
key, so as to keep the Bible steady and the key from falling.&nbsp; Then
the man, who does not consult the <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>future, reads the
verse above written, and should the Bible turn towards the other man, it is
an affirmative answer that the young lady he loves will accept him.</p>
<p>The writer received this account from a man who had himself consulted
the future by the Bible and Key.</p>
<h4><i>Testing a Lover&rsquo;s Love by Cracking of Nuts</i>.</h4>
<p>This divination is common to many countries, but the writer knows that
it is resorted to on <i>All Hallows Eve</i> in Denbighshire by young
ladies, partly, it may be in fun, and partly in earnest.&nbsp; The plan of
proceeding is as follows:&mdash;Nuts are placed on the bars of the fire
grate, equal in number to the young lady&rsquo;s lovers, and the nut that
cracks first, and jumps off the bar, represents her true love.&nbsp; She
has, of course fixed in her mind the lover each nut stands for.&nbsp; So
common is this test that in the North of England <i>All Hallows Eve</i> is
called &ldquo;<i>Nutcrack night</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Gay</i> describes the ceremony:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two hazel nuts I throw into the flame<br />
And to each nut I give a sweetheart&rsquo;s name;<br />
This with the loudest bounce me sore amazed,<br />
That in a flame of brightest-colour blazed;<br />
As blazed the nut, so may thy passions grow,<br />
For &rsquo;twas thy nut that did so brightly glow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Burns</i>, in his poem of <i>Hallowe&rsquo;en</i> also mentions the
nut divination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The auld guidwife&rsquo;s weel-hoordet nits<br />
&nbsp;  Are round an&rsquo; round divided,<br />
An&rsquo; monie lads&rsquo; and lasses&rsquo; fates<br />
&nbsp;  Are there that night decided;<br />
Some kindle, couthie, side by side,<br />
&nbsp;  An&rsquo; burn thegither trimly;<br />
Some start awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; saucy pride,<br />
&nbsp;  And jump out-owre the chimlie<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Fu&rsquo; high that night.<br />
<!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;  An&rsquo; Jean had e&rsquo;en a sair heart<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  To see&rsquo;t that night.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Apple Pip Trial of Lovers.</h3>
<p>The fair lady takes as many pips as she has lovers, and these she places
on the point of a knife, which she inserts between the bars of the fire
grate.&nbsp; Each pip represents a lover, and the pip that swells out and
jumps into the fire indicates that he is the best lover for whom the pip
stands.</p>
<h2>SPIRITUALISM.</h2>
<p>The next subject I shall treat of is curious, and partakes of the nature
of spiritualism.&nbsp; I hardly know by what other word to describe it,
therefore I will give particulars, so as to make the matter intelligible to
the reader, and call it &ldquo;Spiritualism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was believed that it was possible for the spirit to leave the body,
and then, after an absence of some time, to return again and re-enter
it.&nbsp; The form the spirit assumed when it quitted the body was a bluish
light like that of a candle, but somewhat longer.&nbsp; This light left the
body through the mouth, and re-entered the same way.</p>
<p>The writer was informed by a certain female friend at Llandegla that she
had seen a bluish light leave the mouth of a person who was sick, light
which she thought was the life, or spirit of that person, but the person
did not immediately die.</p>
<p><!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>For another tale of this kind I am indebted to Mr. R.&nbsp;
Roberts, who lives in the village of Clocaenog, near Ruthin.&nbsp; He was
not himself a witness of the occurrence, but vouches for the accuracy of
the report.&nbsp; It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h3>A Spirit leaving and re-entering the body.</h3>
<p>A man was in love with two young girls, and they were both in love with
him, and they knew that he flirted with them both.&nbsp; It is but natural
to suppose that these young ladies did not, being rivals, love each
other.&nbsp; It can well be believed that they heartily disliked each
other.&nbsp; One evening, according to custom, this young man spent the
night with one of his sweethearts, and to all appearance she fell asleep,
or was in a trance, for she looked very pale.&nbsp; He noticed her face,
and was frightened by its death-like pallor, but he was greatly surprised
to see <i>a bluish flame proceed out of her mouth</i>, and go towards the
door.&nbsp; He followed this light, and saw it take the direction of the
house in which his other love lived, and he observed that from that house,
too, a like light was travelling, as if to meet the light that he was
following.&nbsp; Ere long these lights met each other, and they apparently
fought, for they dashed into each other, and flitted up and down, as if
engaged in mortal combat.&nbsp; The strife continued for some time, and
then the lights separated and departed in the direction of the respective
houses where the two young women lived.&nbsp; The man returned to the house
of the young woman with whom he was spending the night, following close on
the light, which he saw going before him, and which re-entered her body
through her mouth; and then she immediately awoke.</p>
<p>Here, presumedly, these two troubled young ladies met in a disembodied
form to contend for the possession of this young man.</p>
<p><!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>A tale much like the preceding occurs on page 283.</p>
<p>There is something akin to this spectral appearance believed in in
Scotland, where the apparition is called <i>Wraith</i>, which word is
defined in <i>Jameson&rsquo;s Etymological Dictionary</i>, published by
Gardner, 1882, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wraith</i>, <i>etc</i>.: Properly an apparition in the exact
likeness of a person, supposed by the vulgar to be seen before, or soon
after, death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This definition does not correspond exactly to what has been said of the
Welsh spirit appearance, but it teaches the possibility, or shows the
people&rsquo;s faith in the possibility, of the soul&rsquo;s existence
apart from the body.&nbsp; It would seem that in Scotland this spectre is
seen before, or after, death; but the writer has read of a case in which
the <i>wraith</i> of a person appeared to himself and was the means of
saving his life, and that he long survived after his other self had rescued
him from extreme danger.</p>
<p>Lately a legend of Lake Ogwen went the round of the papers, but the
writer, who lived many years in the neighbourhood of that lake, never heard
of it until he saw it in the papers in 1887.&nbsp; As it bears on the
subject under consideration, I will in part transcribe the
story:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one of these occasions a friend who had known something of the
Welsh gipsies repeated to Rossetti an anecdote which had been told him as a
&lsquo;quite true fack&rsquo; by a Romani girl&mdash;an anecdote touching
another Romani girl <i>whose wraith had been spirited away in the night
from the</i> &lsquo;<i>camping place</i>&rsquo; by the incantations of a
wicked lover, had been seen rushing towards Ogwen Lake in the moonlight,
&lsquo;While all the while that &rsquo;ere same chavi wur asleep an&rsquo;
a-sobbin&rsquo; in her daddy&rsquo;s livin&rsquo;
waggin.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bye-Gones</i>, Ap. 13, 1887.</p>
<p><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>This tale resembles in many respects the one given on page 291,
for there is in both a lover and a sleeping girl, and the girl does not
die, but there are minor differences in the tales, as might be
expected.</p>
<p>In Germany like tales are current.&nbsp; Baring-Gould, in his <i>Myths
of the Middle Ages</i>, pp. 423-4, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The soul in German mythology is supposed to bear some analogy to
a mouse.&nbsp; In Thuringia, at Saalfeld, a servant girl fell asleep whilst
her companions were shelling nuts.&nbsp; They observed <i>a little red
mouse creep out of her mouth</i> and run out of the window.&nbsp; One of
the fellows present shook the sleeper but could not wake her, so he moved
her to another place.&nbsp; Presently the mouse ran back to the former
place and dashed about seeking the girl; not finding her, it vanished; at
the same moment the girl died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other tale on this subject I will give, which appeared in the
<i>North Wales Chronicle</i> for April 22, 1883, where it is
headed&mdash;</p>
<h3>A Spiritualistic Story from Wales.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In an article relating to spiritualism in the February number of
the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, a story was told which is here
shortened.&nbsp; The anecdote is given on the authority of a Welsh
gentleman named Roberts, who resided at Cheetham, near Manchester, and the
scene of the adventure is Beaumaris, the date 184--.&nbsp; The narrator was
then an apprentice in a draper&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; His master was strict,
and allowed his apprentice but half an hour for dinner, which he had to
take at his lodgings, some distance away from the shop.&nbsp; At whatever
time he left the shop he had to be back there punctually at half past
twelve.&nbsp; One day he was late, and while hastily swallowing his meat,
his aunt being at the table, he looked up and saw that the clock pointed to
<i>half past</i> twelve!&nbsp; He was thunderstruck, and, with the <!--
page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>fear of
his master before him, all but lost consciousness, and was indeed in a
dazed state for a few minutes, as was noticed by those at the table.&nbsp;
Shaking this off by an effort, he again looked at the clock, and, to his
relief and astonishment, saw that the hands only pointed to a <i>quarter
past</i> twelve.&nbsp; Then he quickly finished his dinner and returned to
the shop at the appointed time.&nbsp; There he was told that at a
<i>quarter past</i> twelve he had returned to the shop, put up his hat,
moved about in an absent manner, had been scolded, and had thereupon put on
his hat again and walked out.&nbsp; Several persons on the one hand
corroborated this story, whilst on the other his aunt was positive that,
although at that moment he had fallen into a strange fit of abstraction, he
had never left the table.&nbsp; This is the narrative, attested by a
gentleman now living.&nbsp; The year 184-- is not so far back; perhaps
there are still those residing on the upper side of the turf at Beaumaris
who remember the circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tale in its nature is not unlike the others herein given.&nbsp; It
belongs to the supernatural side of life.</p>
<p>However improbable these stories may appear, they point to the notion
that spirits can exist independently of the body.&nbsp; The Irish
<i>fetch</i>, the Scotch <i>wraith</i>, and the Welsh <i>Canwyll Corph</i>,
are alike in their teaching, but of this latter I shall speak more
particularly when treating of death portents.</p>
<h3>A Doctor called from his bed by a Voice.</h3>
<p>Mr. Hugh Lloyd, Llanfihangel-Glyn-Myfyr, who received the story from Dr.
Davies, the gentleman who figures in the tale, informed me of the following
curious incidents:&mdash;</p>
<p>Doctor Davies, of Cerrig-y-drudion, had gone to bed and slept, but in
the night he heard someone under his bedroom window shout that he was
wanted in a farmhouse <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>called Craigeirchan, which was three miles
from the doctor&rsquo;s abode, and the way thereto was at all times beset
with difficulties, such as opening and shutting the many gates; but of a
night the journey to this mountain farm was one that few would think of
taking, unless called to do so by urgent business.&nbsp; The doctor did not
pay much attention to the first request, but he lay quietly on the bed
listening, and almost immediately he heard the same voice requesting him to
go at once to Craigeirchan, as he was wanted there.&nbsp; He now got up to
the window, but could not see anyone; he therefore re-entered his bed, but
for the third time he heard the voice telling him to go to the farm named,
and now he opened the window and said that he would follow the messenger
forthwith.&nbsp; The doctor got up, went to the stable, saddled the horse,
and off he started for a long dismal ride over a wild tract of mountain
country; such a journey he had often taken.&nbsp; He was not surprised that
he could not see, nor hear, anyone in advance, for he knew that Welsh lads
are nimble of foot, and could, by cutting across fields, etc., outstrip a
rider.&nbsp; At last he neared the house where he was wanted, and in the
distance he saw a light, and by this sign he was convinced that there was
sickness in the house.&nbsp; He drove up to the door and entered the abode,
to the surprise but great joy of the inmates.&nbsp; To his inquiry after
the person who had been sent for him, he was told that no one had left the
house, nor had anyone been requested by the family to go to the
doctor.&nbsp; But he was told his services were greatly wanted, for the
wife was about to become a mother, and the doctor was instrumental in
saving both the life of the child and mother.</p>
<p>What makes this tale all the more curious is the fact, that the doctor
was an unbeliever in such things as ghosts, etc., and he had often enjoyed
a quiet laugh over the tales he <!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>heard of a supernatural kind.&nbsp; Mr. Lloyd
asked the doctor whether he had heard of the woman&rsquo;s condition, but
he affirmed he was ignorant of everything connected with the place and
family.</p>
<h3>Another Tale of a Doctor.</h3>
<p>I received the following tale from the Rev. Philip Edwards, formerly
curate at Selattyn, near Oswestry:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was, or perhaps is&mdash;for my informant says he believes the
lady is still alive&mdash;in a place called Swyddffynnon, Cardiganshire, a
Mrs. Evans, who had a strange vision.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards&rsquo;s father
called one evening upon Mrs. Evans, and found her sitting by the fire in
company with a few female friends, greatly depressed.&nbsp; On enquiring as
to the cause of her distress, she stated that she had had a strange sight
that very evening.&nbsp; She saw, she said, in the unoccupied chamber at
the further end of the house, a light, and, whilst she was wondering what
light it was, she observed a tall, dark, stranger gentleman, who had a
long, full beard, enter the house and go straight to the room where the
light was, but before going in he took off his hat and placed it on the
table; then he took off his gloves and threw them into the hat, and then he
placed his riding whip across the hat, and without uttering a single word
he entered the lit-up room.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards she saw the stranger
emerge from the room and leave the house, and on looking again towards the
room she saw that the light had disappeared.&nbsp; It was, she said, this
apparition that had disconcerted her.&nbsp; Some time after this vision
Mrs. Evans was in a critical state, and as she lived far away from a doctor
my informant&rsquo;s father was requested to ride to Aberystwyth for
one.&nbsp; He found, however, that the two doctors who then resided in that
town were from home.&nbsp; But he was informed at the inn that there was a
London doctor <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>staying at Hafod.&nbsp; He determined, whether
he could or could not, induce this gentleman to accompany him to
Swyddffynnon, to go there.&nbsp; The gentleman, on hearing the urgency of
the case, consented to visit the sick woman.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards and the
doctor rode rapidly to their destination, and Mr. Edwards was surprised to
find that the doctor did everything exactly as had been stated by Mrs.
Evans.&nbsp; There was also a light in the chamber, for there the
neighbours had placed the still-born child, and it was the providential
help of the London doctor that saved Mrs. Evans&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; I may
add that the personal appearance of this gentleman corresponded with the
description given of him by Mrs. Evans.</p>
<h2>DEATH PORTENTS.</h2>
<p>These are common, in one form or other, to all nations.&nbsp; I will
give a list of those which were formerly in high repute in Wales.</p>
<h3>The Corpse Bird, or Deryn Corph.</h3>
<p>This was a bird that came flapping its wings against the window of the
room in which lay a sick person, and this visit was considered a certain
omen of that person&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The bird not only fluttered about
the lighted window, but also made a screeching noise whilst there, and also
as it flew away.&nbsp; The bird, singled out for the dismal honour of being
a death prognosticator, was the tawny, or screech owl.&nbsp; Many are the
instances, which have been told me by persons who heard the bird&rsquo;s
noise, of its having been the precursor of death.&nbsp; This superstition
is common to all parts of Wales.</p>
<h3>A Crowing Hen.</h3>
<p>This bird, too, is supposed to indicate the death of an inmate of the
house which is its home; or, if not the death, some sore disaster to one or
other of the members of that <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>family.&nbsp; The poor hen, though, as soon as
it is heard crowing, certainly foretells its own death, for no one will
keep such an uncanny bird on the premises, and consequently the crowing hen
loses its life.</p>
<p>It is a common saying that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A whistling woman, and a <i>crowing hen</i>,<br />
Are neither good for God nor men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should a hen lay a small egg it was to be thrown over the head, and over
the roof of the house, or a death would follow.</p>
<h3>A Cock Crowing in the Night.</h3>
<p>This, too, was thought to foretell a death, but whose death, depended on
the direction of the bird&rsquo;s head whilst crowing.&nbsp; As soon as the
crowing was heard someone went to ascertain the position of the
cock&rsquo;s head, and when it was seen that his head was turned from their
own house towards someone else&rsquo;s abode, the dwellers in that house
slept in peace, believing that a neighbour, and not one of themselves, was
about to die.&nbsp; It was supposed, that to make the prognostication sure,
the cock would have to crow three times in succession before or about
midnight, and in the same direction.</p>
<h3>The Corpse Candle&mdash;Canwyll Corph.</h3>
<p>The corpse candle, or <i>canwyll corph</i>, was a light like that of a
candle, which was said to issue from the house where a death was about to
occur, and take the course of the funeral procession to the burial
place.&nbsp; This was the usual way of proceeding, but this mysterious
light was also thought to wend its way to the abode of a person about to
die.&nbsp; Instances could be given of both kinds of appearances.</p>
<p>I have met with persons in various parts of Wales who told me that they
had seen a corpse candle.&nbsp; They <!-- page 299--><a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>described it as a
pale bluish light moving slowly along a short distance above the
ground.&nbsp; Strange tales are told of the course the light has
taken.&nbsp; Once it was seen to go over hedges and to make straight for
the churchyard wall.&nbsp; This was not then understood, but when the
funeral actually took place the ground was covered with snow, and the drift
caused the procession to proceed along the fields and over the hedges and
churchyard wall, as indicated by the corpse candle.</p>
<p>It was ill jesting with the corpse candle.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Jenkins,
Vicar of Hirnant, told me that a drunken sailor at Borth said he went up to
a corpse candle and attempted to light his pipe at it, but he was whisked
away, and when he came to himself he discovered that he was far off the
road in the bog.</p>
<p>The Rev. Edmund Jones, in his book entitled <i>A Relation of Ghosts and
Apparitions</i>, <i>etc</i>., states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Some have seen the resemblance of a skull carrying the candle;
others the shape of the person that is to die carrying the candle between
his fore-fingers, holding the light before his face.&nbsp; Some have said
that they saw the shape of those who were to be at the burying.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have followed the light state that it proceeded to the church,
lit up the building, emerged therefrom, and then hovered awhile over a
certain spot in the churchyard, and then sank into the earth at the place
where the deceased was to be buried.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that St. David, by prayer, obtained the corpse
candle as a sign to the living of the reality of another world, and that
originally it was confined to his diocese.&nbsp; This tradition finds no
place in the Life of the Saint, as given in the <i>Cambro-British
Saints</i>, and there are there many wonderful things recorded of that
saint.</p>
<p><!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>It was thought possible for a man to meet his own Candle.&nbsp;
There is a tale of a person who met a Candle and struck it with his
walking-stick, when it became sparks, which, however, re-united.&nbsp; The
man was greatly frightened, became sick, and died.&nbsp; At the spot where
he had struck the candle the bier broke and the coffin fell to the ground,
thus corroborating the man&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>I will now record one tale not of the usual kind, which was told me by a
person who is alive.</p>
<h3>Tale of a Corpse Candle.</h3>
<p>My informant told me that one John Roberts, Felin-y-Wig, was in the
habit of sitting up a short time after his family had retired to rest to
smoke a quiet pipe, and the last thing he usually did before retiring for
the night was to take a peep into the night.&nbsp; One evening, whilst
peering around, he saw in the distance a light, where he knew there was no
house, and on further notice he observed that it was slowly going along the
road from Bettws-Gwerfil-Goch towards Felin-y-Wig.&nbsp; Where the road
dipped the light disappeared, only, however, to appear again in such parts
of the road as were visible from John Roberts&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; At first
Roberts thought that the light proceeded from a lantern, but this was so
unusual an occurrence in those parts that he gave up this idea, and
intently followed the motions of the light.&nbsp; It approached
Roberts&rsquo;s house, and evidently this was its destination.&nbsp; He
endeavoured to ascertain whether the light was carried by a man or woman,
but he could see nothing save the light.&nbsp; When, therefore, it turned
into the lane approaching Roberts&rsquo;s house, in considerable fear he
entered the house and closed the door, awaiting, with fear, the approach of
the light.&nbsp; To his horror, he perceived the light passing through the
shut door, and it played in a quivering way underneath the roof, <!-- page
301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>and then
vanished.&nbsp; That very night the servant man died, and his bed was right
above the spot where the light had disappeared.</p>
<h3>Spectral Funerals, or Drychiolaeth.</h3>
<p>This was a kind of shadowy funeral which foretold the real one.&nbsp; In
South Wales it goes by the name <i>toilu</i>, <i>toili</i>, or <i>y
teulu</i> (the family) <i>anghladd</i>, unburied; in Montgomeryshire it is
called <i>Drychiolaeth</i>, spectre.</p>
<p>I cannot do better than quote from Mr. Hamer&rsquo;s <i>Parochial
Account of Llanidloes (Montgomeryshire Collections</i>, vol. x., p. 256), a
description of one of these phantom funerals.&nbsp; All were much
alike.&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a few years ago that some excitement was caused
amongst the superstitious portion of the inhabitants by the statement of a
certain miner, who at the time was working at the Brynpostig mine.&nbsp; On
his way to the mine one dark night, he said that he was thoroughly
frightened in China Street on seeing a spectral funeral leaving the house
of one Hoskiss, who was then very ill in bed.&nbsp; In his fright the miner
turned his back on the house, with the intention of going home, but almost
fainting he could scarcely move out of the way of the advancing procession,
which gradually approached, at last surrounded him, and then passed on down
Longbridge Street, in the direction of the church.&nbsp; The frightened man
managed with difficulty to drag himself home, but he was so ill that he was
unable to go to work for several days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following weird tale I received from the Rev. Philip Edwards, whom I
have already mentioned (p. 282).&nbsp; I may state that I have heard
variants of the story from other sources.</p>
<p>While the Manchester and Milford Railway was in course of construction
there was a large influx of navvies into <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Wales, and many a
frugal farmer added to his incomings by lodging and boarding workmen
engaged on the line.&nbsp; Several of these men were lodged at a farm
called Penderlwyngoch, occupied by a man named Hughes.</p>
<p>One evening when the men were seated round the fire, which burned
brightly, they heard the farm dogs bark, as they always did at the approach
of strangers.&nbsp; This aroused the attention of the men, and they
perceived from the furious barking of the dogs that someone was coming
towards the house.&nbsp; By-and-by they heard the tramp of feet, mingled
with the howling of the frightened dogs, and then the dogs ceased barking,
just as if they had slunk away in terror.&nbsp; Before many minutes had
elapsed the inmates heard the back door opened, and a number of people
entered the house, carrying a heavy load resembling a dead man, which they
deposited in the parlour, and all at once the noise ceased.&nbsp; The men
in great dread struck a light, and proceeded to the parlour to ascertain
what had taken place.&nbsp; But they could discover nothing there, neither
were there any marks of feet in the room, nor could they find any
footprints outside the house, but they saw the cowering dogs in the yard
looking the picture of fright.&nbsp; After this fruitless investigation of
the cause of this dread sound, the Welsh people present only too well knew
the cause of this visit.&nbsp; On the very next day one of the men who sat
by the fire was killed, and his body was carried by his fellow-workmen to
the farm house, in fact everything occurred as rehearsed the previous
night.&nbsp; Most of the people who witnessed the vision are, my informant
says, still alive.</p>
<h3>Cyhyraeth&mdash;Death Sound.</h3>
<p>This was thought to be a sound made by a crying spirit.&nbsp; It was
plaintive, yet loud and terrible.&nbsp; It made the hair <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>stand on end and the
blood become cold; and a whole neighbourhood became depressed whenever the
awful sound was heard.&nbsp; It was unlike all other voices, and it could
not be mistaken.&nbsp; It took in its course the way the funeral procession
was to go, starting from the house of the dead, and ending in the
churchyard where the deceased was to be buried.&nbsp; It was supposed to
announce a death the morning before it occurred, or, at most, a few days
before.&nbsp; It was at one time thought to belong to persons born in the
Diocese of Llandaff, but it must have travelled further north, for it is
said to have been heard on the Kerry Hills in Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; The
function of the <i>Cyhyraeth</i> was much the same as that of the Corpse
Candle, but it appealed to the sense of sound instead of to the sense of
sight.&nbsp; Dogs, when they heard the distressing sound of the
<i>Cyhyraeth</i>, showed signs of fear and ran away to hide.</p>
<h3>Lledrith&mdash;Spectre of a Person.</h3>
<p>This apparition of a friend has in the Scotch wraith, or Irish fetch its
counterpart.&nbsp; It has been said that people have seen friends walking
to meet them, and that, when about to shake hands with the approaching
person, it has vanished into air.&nbsp; This optical illusion was
considered to be a sign of the death of the person thus seen.</p>
<h3>Tolaeth&mdash;Death Rapping or Knocking.</h3>
<p>The death rappings are said to be heard in carpenters&rsquo; workshops,
and that they resembled the noise made by a carpenter when engaged in
coffin-making.&nbsp; A respectable miner&rsquo;s wife told me that a female
friend told her, she had often heard this noise in a carpenter&rsquo;s shop
close by her abode, and that one Sunday evening this friend came and told
her that the <i>Tolaeth</i> was at work then, and if she would come with
her she should hear it.&nbsp; She complied, and there she heard this
peculiar sound, and was thoroughly frightened.&nbsp; <!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>There was no one in
the shop at the time, the carpenter and his wife being in chapel.&nbsp;
Sometimes this noise was heard by the person who was to die, but generally
by his neighbours.&nbsp; The sounds were heard in houses even, and when
this was the case the noise resembled the noise made as the shroud is being
nailed to the coffin.</p>
<h3>A Raven&rsquo;s Croaking.</h3>
<p>A raven croaking hoarsely as it flew through the air became the angel of
death to some person over whose house it flew.&nbsp; It was a bird of ill
omen.</p>
<h3>The Owl.</h3>
<p>This bird&rsquo;s dismal and persistent screeching near an abode also
foretold the death of an inmate of that house.</p>
<h3>A Solitary Crow.</h3>
<p>The cawing of a solitary crow on a tree near a house indicates a death
in that house.</p>
<h3>The Dog&rsquo;s Howl.</h3>
<p>A dog howling on the doorsteps or at the entrance of a house also
foretold death.&nbsp; The noise was that peculiar howling noise which dogs
sometimes make.&nbsp; It was in Welsh called <i>yn udo</i>, or crying.</p>
<h3>Missing a Butt.</h3>
<p>Should a farmer in sowing wheat, or other kind of corn, or potatoes, or
turnips, miss a row or butt, it was a token of death.</p>
<h3>Stopping of a Clock.</h3>
<p>The unaccountable stopping of the kitchen clock generally created a
consternation in a family, for it was supposed to foretell the death of one
of the family.</p>
<h3>A Goose Flying over a House.</h3>
<p>This unusual occurrence prognosticated a death in that house.</p>
<h3><!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span><i>Goose or Hen Laying a Small Egg</i>.</h3>
<p>This event also was thought to be a very bad omen, if not a sign of
death.</p>
<h3>Hen laying Two Eggs in the same day.</h3>
<p>Should a hen lay two eggs in the same day, it was considered a sign of
death.&nbsp; I have been told that a hen belonging to a person who lived in
Henllan, near Denbigh, laid an egg early in the morning, and another about
seven o&rsquo;clock p.m. in the same day, and the master died.</p>
<h3>Thirteen at a Table.</h3>
<p>Should thirteen sit at a table it was believed that the first to leave
would be buried within the year.</p>
<h3>Heather.</h3>
<p>Should any person bring heather into a house, he brought death to one or
other of the family by so doing.</p>
<h3>Death Watch.</h3>
<p>This is a sound, like the ticking of a watch, made by a small
insect.&nbsp; It is considered a sign of death, and hence its name,
<i>Death Watch</i>.</p>
<p>A working man&rsquo;s wife, whose uncle was ill in bed, told the writer,
that she had no hopes of his recovery, because death ticks were heard night
and day in his room.&nbsp; The man, who was upwards of eighty years old,
died.</p>
<h3>Music and Bird Singing heard before Death.</h3>
<p>The writer, both in Denbighshire and Carnarvonshire, was told that the
dying have stated that they heard sweet voices singing in the air, and they
called the attention of the watchers to the angelic sounds, and requested
perfect stillness, so as not to lose a single note of the heavenly
music.</p>
<p><!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>A young lad, whom the writer knew&mdash;an intelligent and
promising boy&mdash;whilst lying on his death-bed, told his mother that he
heard a bird warbling beautifully outside the house, and in rapture he
listened to the bird&rsquo;s notes.</p>
<p>His mother told me of this, and she stated further, that she had herself
on three different occasions previously to her eldest daughter&rsquo;s
death, in the middle of the night, distinctly heard singing of the most
lovely kind, coming, as she thought, from the other side of the
river.&nbsp; She went to the window and opened it, but the singing
immediately ceased, and she failed to see anyone on the spot where she had
imagined the singing came from.&nbsp; My informant also told me that she
was not the only person who heard lovely singing before the death of a
friend.&nbsp; She gave me the name of a nurse, who before the death of a
person, whose name was also given me, heard three times the most beautiful
singing just outside the sick house.&nbsp; She looked out into the night,
but failed to see anyone.&nbsp; Singing of this kind is expected before the
death of every good person, and it is a happy omen that the dying is going
to heaven.</p>
<p>In the <i>Life of Tegid</i>, which is given in his <i>Gwaith
Barddonawl</i>, p. 20, it is stated:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yn ei absenoldeb o&rsquo;r Eglwys, pan ar wely angeu, ar fore
dydd yr Arglwydd, tra yr oedd offeiriad cymmydogaethol yn darllen yn ei le
yn Llan Nanhyfer, boddwyd llais y darllenydd gan fwyalchen a darawai drwy
yr Eglwys accen uchel a pherseiniol yn ddisymwth iawn. . . .&nbsp; Ar ol
dyfod o&rsquo;r Eglwys cafwyd allan mai ar yr amser hwnw yn gywir yr
ehedodd enaid mawr Tegid o&rsquo;i gorph i fyd yr ysprydoedd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which translated is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>In his absence from Church, when lying on his deathbed, in the morning
of the Lord&rsquo;s Day, whilst a <!-- page 307--><a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>neighbouring
clergyman was taking the service for him in Nanhyfer Church, the voice of
the reader was suddenly drowned by the beautiful song of a thrush, that
filled the whole Church. . . .&nbsp; It was ascertained on leaving the
church that at that very moment the soul of Tegid left his body for the
world of spirits.</p>
<p>In the <i>Myths of the Middle Ages</i>, p. 426, an account is given of
&ldquo;The Piper of Hamelin,&rdquo; and there we have a description of this
spirit song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet angels are calling to me from yon shore,<br />
Come over, come over, and wander no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miners believe that some of their friends have the gift of seeing fatal
accidents before they occur.&nbsp; A miner in the East of Denbighshire told
me of instances of this belief and he gave circumstantial proof of the
truth of his assertion.&nbsp; Akin to this faith is the belief that people
have seen coffins or spectral beings enter houses, both of which augur a
coming death.</p>
<p>In <i>The Lives of the Cambro-British Saints</i>, p. 444, it is stated
that previously to the death of St. David &ldquo;the whole city was filled
with the music of angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preceding death omens do not, perhaps, exhaust the number, but they
are quite enough to show how prevalent they were, and how prone the people
were to believe in such portents.&nbsp; Some of them can be accounted for
on natural grounds, but the majority are the creation of the imagination,
strengthened possibly in certain instances by remarkable coincidences which
were remembered, whilst if no death occurred after any of the omens, the
failure was forgotten.</p>

308</span>BIRDS AND BEASTS.</h2>
<p>Folk-lore respecting animals is common in Wales.&nbsp; It has been
supposed that mountainous countries are the cradles of superstitions.&nbsp;
But this is, at least, open to a doubt; for most places perpetuate these
strange fancies, and many of them have reached our days from times of old,
and the exact country whence they came is uncertain.&nbsp; Still, it cannot
be denied that rugged, rocky, sparsely inhabited uplands, moorlands, and
fens, are congenial abodes for wild fancies, that have their foundation in
ignorance, and are perpetuated by the credulity of an imaginative people
that lead isolated and solitary lives.</p>
<p>The bleating of the sheep, as they wander over a large expanse of barren
mountain land, is dismal indeed, and well might become ominous of storms
and disasters.&nbsp; The big fat sheep, which are penned in the lowlands of
England, with a tinkling bell strapped to the neck of the king of the
flock, convey a notion of peace and plenty to the mind of the spectator,
that the shy active mountain sheep, with their angry grunt and stamping of
their feet never convey.&nbsp; Still, these latter are endowed with an
instinct which the English mutton-producer does not exercise.&nbsp; Welsh
sheep become infallible prognosticators of a change of weather; for, by a
never failing instinct, they leave the high and bare mountain ridges for
sheltered nooks, and crowd together when they detect the approach of a
storm.&nbsp; Man does not observe atmospheric changes as quickly as sheep
do, and as sheep evidently possess one instinct which is strongly developed
and exercised, it is not unreasonable to suppose that man in a low state of
civilisation might credit animals with possessing powers which, if
observed, indicate or foretell other events beside storms.</p>
<p><!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>Thus the lowly piping of the solitary curlew, the saucy burr of
the grouse, the screech of the owl, the croaking of the raven, the flight
of the magpie, the slowly flying heron, the noisy cock, the hungry seagull,
the shrill note of the woodpecker, the sportive duck, all become omens.</p>
<p>Bird omens have descended to us from remote antiquity.&nbsp; Rome is
credited with having received its pseudo-science of omens from Etruria, but
whence came it there?&nbsp; This semi-religious faith, like a river that
has its source in a far distant, unexplored mountain region, and meanders
through many countries, and does not exclusively belong to any one of the
lands through which it wanders; so neither does it seem that these
credulities belong to any one people or age; and it is difficult, if not
impossible, to trace to their origin, omens, divination, magic, witchcraft,
and other such cognate matters, which seem to belong to man&rsquo;s
nature.</p>
<p>Readers of Livy remember how Romulus and Remus had recourse to bird
omens to determine which of the brothers should build Rome.&nbsp; Remus saw
six vultures, and Romulus twelve; therefore, as his number was the greater,
to him fell the honour of building the famous city.</p>
<p>But this was not the only bird test known to the Romans.&nbsp; Before a
battle those people consulted their game fowl to ascertain whether or not
victory was about to attend their arms.&nbsp; If the birds picked up
briskly the food thrown to them victory was theirs, if they did so
sluggishly the omen was unpropitious, and consequently the battle was
delayed.</p>
<p>Plutarch, in his &ldquo;Life of Alexander,&rdquo; gives us many proofs
of that great general&rsquo;s credulity.&nbsp; The historian
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Upon his (Alexander&rsquo;s) approach to the walls (of
Babylon) he saw a great number of crows fighting, some of which fell down
dead at his feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a bad sign.&nbsp; But I will not
pursue the subject.&nbsp; Enough has been said <!-- page 310--><a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>to prove how common
omens were.&nbsp; I will now confine my remarks to Wales.</p>
<h3>Birds singing before February.</h3>
<p>Should the feathered songsters sing before February it is a sign of
hard, ungenial weather.&nbsp; This applies particularly to the blackbird
and throstle.&nbsp; The following lines embody this faith:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Os c&acirc;n yr adar cyn Chwefror, hwy griant cyn Mai.</p>
<p>If birds sing before February, they will cry before May.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus their early singing prognosticates a prolonged
winter.&mdash;<i>Bye-Gones</i>, vol. i., p. 88.</p>
<h3>Birds flocking in early Autumn.</h3>
<p>When birds gather themselves together and form flocks in the early days
of autumn, it is thought to foretell an early and severe winter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, should they separate in early spring, and again
congregate in flocks, this shews that hard weather is to be expected, and
that winter will rest on the lap of May.</p>
<h3>Birds&rsquo; Feathers.</h3>
<p>Feather beds should be made of domestic birds&rsquo; feathers, such as
geese, ducks, and fowls.&nbsp; Wild fowl feathers should not be mixed with
these feathers; for, otherwise, the sick will die hard, and thus the agony
of their last moments will be prolonged.</p>
<h3>The Cock.</h3>
<p>C&aelig;sar, Bk. v., c.12, tells us that the Celtic nation did not
regard it lawful to eat the cock.</p>
<p>It was thought that the devil assumed occasionally the form of a
cock.&nbsp; It is said that at Llanfor, near Bala, the evil spirit was
driven out of the church in the form of a cock, and laid in the river
Dee.</p>
<p><!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>Formerly the cock was offered to the water god.&nbsp; And at
certain Holy Wells in Wales, such as that in the parish of Llandegla, it
was customary to offer to St. Tecla a cock for a male patient, and a hen
for a female.&nbsp; A like custom prevailed at St. Deifer&rsquo;s Well,
Bodfari.&nbsp; Classical readers may remember that Socrates, before his
death, desired his friend Crito to offer a cock to &AElig;sculapius.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Crito,&rdquo; said he, and these were his last words, &ldquo;we owe
a cock to &AElig;sculapius, discharge that debt for me, and pray do not
forget it;&rdquo; soon after which he breathed his last.</p>
<p>In our days, the above-mentioned superstitions do not prevail, but the
cock has not been resigned entirely to the cook.&nbsp; By some means or
other, it still retains the power of announcing the visit of a friend; at
least, so says the mountain farmer&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>The good-wife in North Wales, when the cock comes to the door-sill and
there crows many times in succession, tells her children that &ldquo;Some
one is coming to visit us, I wonder who it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before
nightfall a friend drops in, and he is informed that he was expected, that
the cock had crowed time after time by the door, and that it was no good
sending him away, for he would come back and crow and crow, &ldquo;and
now,&rdquo; adds she, &ldquo;you have come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not
strange,&rdquo; says the good woman, &ldquo;that he never makes a
mistake,&rdquo; and then follows a word of praise for chanticleer, which
the stranger endorses.</p>
<p>However much the hospitable liked to hear their cock crow in the day
time, he was not to crow at night.&nbsp; But it was formerly believed that
at the crowing of the cock, fairies, spirits, ghosts, and goblins rushed to
their dread abodes.&nbsp; Puck was to meet the Fairy King, &ldquo;ere the
first cock crow.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span><i>Cock-fighting</i>.</h3>
<p>Cock-fighting was once common in Wales, and it was said that the most
successful cock-fighters fought the bird that resembled the colour of the
day when the conflict took place; thus, the blue game-cock was brought out
on cloudy days, black when the atmosphere was inky in colour, black-red on
sunny days, and so on.</p>
<p>Charms for cocks have already been mentioned (p. 267).&nbsp; These
differed in different places.&nbsp; In Llansantffraid, Montgomeryshire, a
crumb from the communion table, taken therefrom at midnight following the
administration of the Holy Communion, was an infallible charm.&nbsp; This
was placed in the socket of the steel spur, which was then adjusted to the
natural spur.&mdash;<i>Bye-Gones</i>, vol. i., p. 88.</p>
<h3>The Goose.</h3>
<p>Should a goose lay a soft egg, a small egg, or two eggs in a day, it is
a sign of misfortune to the owner of that goose.</p>
<p>An old woman in Llandrinio parish, Montgomeryshire, who lived in a
cottage by the side of the Severn, and who possessed a breed of geese that
laid eggs and hatched twice a year, when I asked her the time that geese
should begin to lay, said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day<br />
Every good goose will lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and she added:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By St. Chad,<br />
Every good goose, and bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Chad&rsquo;s Day is March the 2nd.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Williams, Fron, Selattyn, gave me the following version of
the above ditty:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Candlemas Day,<br />
Every good goose begins to lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>Another rendering is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every good goose ought to lay<br />
On Candlemas Day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Candlemas Day is February 2nd.</p>
<p>Geese should sit so as to hatch their young when the moon waxes and not
when it wanes, for, otherwise, the goslings would not thrive.&nbsp; The
lucky one in the family should place the eggs for hatching under the goose
or hen.</p>
<p>For the following paragraph I am indebted to &ldquo;Ffraid,&rdquo; a
writer in <i>Bye-Gones</i>, vol. i., p. 88:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goose is thought to be a silly bird, and hence the
expression, &lsquo;You silly goose,&rsquo; or &lsquo;You stupid
goose,&rsquo; as applied to a person.&nbsp; The falling snow is believed to
be the effect of celestial goose-feathering, and the patron of
geese&mdash;St. Michael&mdash;is supposed to be then feathering his
proteg&eacute;s.&nbsp; The first goose brought to table is called a
Michaelmas goose; a large annual fair at Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant is called
&lsquo;Ffair y cwarter Gwydd,&rsquo; the quarter goose fair.&nbsp; Seven
geese on grass land are supposed to eat as much grass as will keep a
cow.&nbsp; Permanent grass land is called &lsquo;Tir Gwydd,&rsquo; goose
land.&nbsp; A bed of goose feathers is required to complete a
well-furnished house.&nbsp; The fat of geese, called
&lsquo;goose-oil,&rsquo; is a recipe for many ailments.&nbsp; A small bone
in the head of a goose, called the &lsquo;goose&rsquo;s tooth,&rsquo; is
carried in the pocket for luck, and is a sure preventative against
toothache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the above paragraph is common to most parts of Wales, but the
writer used to be told, when he was a lad, that the snow was caused by
&ldquo;the old woman feathering her geese,&rdquo; and a Michaelmas goose
was called a green goose, as well as a &ldquo;Michaelmas goose.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span><i>The Crow</i>.</h3>
<p>The crow figures much in Welsh folk-lore.&nbsp; In many ways he is made
to resemble the magpie; thus, when one crow or one magpie was seen, it was
thought to foretell misfortune, as implied by the saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Un fr&acirc;n ddu,<br />
Lwc ddrwg i mi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But should the spectator shout out in a defiant way:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hen fr&acirc;n ddu,<br />
Gras Duw i mi,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>no harm would follow.&nbsp; The former lines in English would
be:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One crow I see,<br />
Bad luck to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this foretold evil, brought about by the old black crow, could be
counteracted by repeating the following words, (a translation of the second
couplet), with a pause between each line, and thus the last line would
assume the form of a prayer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Black Crow!<br />
God, grace bestow;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or the evil could be hurled back upon the Old Black Crow by the
repetition of these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hen fr&acirc;n ddu,<br />
Gras Duw i mi,<br />
Lwc ddrwg i ti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freely translated, these lines would be:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Black Crow!<br />
God&rsquo;s grace to me,<br />
Bad luck to thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the English-speaking parts of Wales, such as along the borders of
Montgomeryshire, adjoining Shropshire, I have heard the following doggerel
lines substituted for the Welsh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crow, crow, get out of my sight,<br />
Before I kill thee to-morrow night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bad luck implied by the appearance of one crow <!-- page 315--><a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>could also be
overcome, as in the case of the magpie, by making a cross on the ground,
with finger or stick.</p>
<p>Although one crow implied bad luck, two crows meant good luck; thus we
have these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dwy fr&acirc;n ddu,<br />
Lwc dda i mi.</p>
<p>Two black crows,<br />
Good luck to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many prognostications were drawn from the appearance of crows.&nbsp; A
crow seen on the highest branch of a tree implied that the person seeing it
should shortly see his or her sweetheart.&nbsp; The manner in which they
flew foretold a wedding or a burying.&nbsp; When they fly in a long line
there is to be a wedding, if crowded together a funeral.</p>
<p>There is a common expression in Montgomeryshire&mdash;&ldquo;Dwy
fr&acirc;n dyddyn&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The two crows of the
farm&rdquo;&mdash;just as if each farm had its two crows, either as
guardians of the farm&mdash;for two crows implied good luck&mdash;or as if
they were located by couples in various places, which places became their
feeding ground and homes.&nbsp; This, however, is not true of rooks, which
feed in flocks and roost in flocks.</p>
<h3>Crows&rsquo; Feathers.</h3>
<p>In Montgomeryshire it was, at one time, supposed that if a person picked
up a crow&rsquo;s feather he was sure to meet a mad dog before the day was
over.</p>
<p>But in other parts it was considered lucky to find a crow&rsquo;s
feather, if, when found, it were stuck on end into the ground.&nbsp; This
superstition lingered long in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, a remote, hilly
parish in Denbighshire.</p>
<p>Some years ago, crows&rsquo; wing or tail feathers could be seen stuck
upright in the ground in many parts of Wales, but at present such a thing
cannot be seen.&nbsp; The practice and the superstition have come to an
end.</p>
<h3><!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span><i>A Rookery deserted was a sign of bad luck</i>, <i>but when
they nested near a house it was a sign of good luck</i>.</h3>
<p>The writer visited, in the year 1887, a gentleman&rsquo;s park, where
for generations the rooks had made a lodgment, and by several persons his
attention was called to the ominous fact that the rooks had left the
ancestral trees which ornamented the spacious and well-wooded park, and had
even carried their nests away with them.&nbsp; He was informed that the
desertion boded no good to the highly respected family that occupied that
ancient seat.</p>
<p>The writer also visited a friend, who lives in an ancient abode, a mile
or two from the rook-rejected park, and, with a smile, he was informed by
the lady of the house that a colony of rooks had taken possession of the
trees that surrounded her house.&nbsp; He gladly wished her luck, to which
she responded&mdash;&ldquo;It has been a long time coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both these places are in East Denbighshire.</p>
<p>The writer remembers a case in which a rookery was deserted just before
misfortune fell upon the gentleman who occupied the house around which grew
the trees occupied by the rooks.&nbsp; This gentleman one morning noticed
the rooks carrying away their nests to a new home.&nbsp; Se called his
servant man to him, and desired him to go after the rooks and destroy their
nests in their new abode, in the fond hope that they would thus be induced
to return to their old home.&nbsp; This was done more than once, but the
rooks would not take the hint; they persisted in gathering up the scattered
sticks that strewed the ground, but these they replaced in the trees above,
which now had become their new home.&nbsp; When it was found that they
would not return, the man desisted, and his master, as he had feared, met
with dire misfortune shortly afterwards (see p. 304).</p>
<h3><!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span><i>The Cuckoo</i>.&nbsp; <i>Y G&ocirc;g</i>.</h3>
<p>The cuckoo is a sacred bird.&nbsp; It is safe from the
gamekeeper&rsquo;s gun.&nbsp; Its advent is welcomed with pleasure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you heard the cuckoo?&rdquo; is a question put by the fortunate
person who first hears its notes to every person he meets.&nbsp; When it is
ascertained that the cuckoo has arrived, parents give their children pence
for luck, and they themselves take care not to leave their houses with
empty pockets, for should they do so, those pockets, if the cuckoo is
heard, will be empty all the year.&nbsp; Those who hear the cuckoo for the
first time thrust immediately their hand in their pockets, and turn their
money, or toss a piece into the air, and all this is for luck for the
coming year ushered in by the cheering sound of the cuckoo&rsquo;s
notes.</p>
<p>It is believed that the cuckoo is in our country for several days before
its welcome two notes are heard, and that the cause of its huskiness is,
that it is tired, and has not cleared its voice by sucking birds&rsquo;
eggs.</p>
<p>Generally the cuckoo is heard for the first time yearly about the same
place, and the hill tops not far from the abodes of man are its favourite
resort.&nbsp; Thus we have the ditty:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynta&rsquo; lle y c&acirc;n y cogydd,<br />
Yw y fawnog ar y mynydd.</p>
<p>The place where first the cuckoo sings,<br />
Is by the peat pits on the hills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cuckoo is supposed to be accompanied by the wry-neck, hence its
name, &ldquo;Gwas-y-g&ocirc;g,&rdquo; the cuckoo&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp; The
wryneck was thought to build the nest, and hatch and feed the young of the
cuckoo.</p>
<p>Many superstitions cluster round the cuckoo; thus, should a person be in
doubt as to the way to take, when going from home, to secure success in
life, he, or she, waits <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>for the cuckoo&rsquo;s return, and then should
the bird be heard for the first time, singing towards the east, as it
flies, that is the direction to take, or any other direction as the case
may be; and it is, or was, even thought that the flight of the cuckoo,
singing as it flies before a person, for the first time in the year,
indicated a change of abode for that person, and the new home lay in the
direction in which the cuckoo flew.</p>
<p>Should the cuckoo make its appearance before the leaves appear on the
hawthorn bush, it is a sign of a dry, barren year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Os c&acirc;n y g&ocirc;g ar ddrain-llwyn llwm,<br />
Gwerth dy geffyl a phryn dy bwn.</p>
<p>If the cuckoo sings on a hawthorn bare,<br />
Sell thy horse, and thy pack prepare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Welsh words I heard at Llanuwchllyn, a good many years ago, just as
the cuckoo&rsquo;s voice was heard for the first time in those parts, and
there were then no leaves out on the hedgerows.&nbsp; I do not recollect
whether the prophecy became true, but it was an aged Welshman that made use
of the words.&nbsp; Another version of the same is heard in Llanwddyn
parish:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Os c&acirc;n y g&ocirc;g ar bincyn llwm,<br />
Gwerth dy geffyl a phryn dy bwn.</p>
<p>If the cuckoo sings on a sprig that&rsquo;s bare,<br />
Sell thy horse, and thy pack prepare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter ditty suits a hilly country, and the former applies to the
low lands where there are hedgerows.</p>
<p>The early singing of the cuckoo implies a plentiful crop of hay, and
this belief is embodied in the following ditty:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mis cyn Clamme c&acirc;n y c&ocirc;ge,<br />
Mis cyn Awst y cana&rsquo; inne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>That is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the cuckoo sings a month before May-day,<br />
I will sing a month before August.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Calan Mai</i>, May-day, abbreviated to <i>Clamme</i>, according to
the Old Style, corresponds with our 12th of May, and the above saying
means, that there would be such an abundant hay harvest if the cuckoo sang
a month before May-day, that the farmer would himself sing for joy on the
12th of July.&nbsp; It was the custom in the uplands of Wales to begin the
hay harvest on the 1st of July.</p>
<p>The above I heard in Montgomeryshire, and also the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mis cyn Clamme c&acirc;n y c&ocirc;ge,<br />
Mis cyn hynny tyf mriallu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the cuckoo sings a month before May-day,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Primroses will grow a month before that time.</p>
<p>I do not know what this means, unless it implies that early primroses
foretell an early summer.</p>
<p>But, speaking of the song of the cuckoo, we have the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amser i ganu ydi Ebrill a Mai,<br />
A hanner Mehefin, chwi wyddoch bob rhai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This corresponds somewhat with the English:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cuckoo sings in April,<br />
The cuckoo sings in May,<br />
The cuckoo sings to the middle of June,<br />
And then she flies away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Mochdre parish, Montgomeryshire, I was told the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In May she sings all day,<br />
In June she&rsquo;s out of tune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>The following Welsh lines show that the cuckoo will not sing when
the hay harvest begins:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pan welith hi gocyn,<br />
Ni chanith hi gwcw.</p>
<p>When she sees a heap,<br />
Silence she will keep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In certain parts of Wales, such as Montgomeryshire, bordering on
Shropshire, it is thought that the cuckoo never sings after
Midsummer-day.&nbsp; This faith finds corroborative support in the
following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cuckoo sings in April,<br />
The cuckoo sings in May,<br />
The cuckoo sings in Midsummer,<br />
But never on that day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Flintshire, in Hawarden parish, it is believed that she mates in
June, as shown by these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cuckoo comes in April,<br />
The cuckoo sings in May,<br />
The cuckoo mates in June,<br />
And in July she flies away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Montgomeryshire I have often heard these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cuckoo is a fine bird,<br />
She sings as she flies,<br />
She brings us good tidings,<br />
And never tells us lies;<br />
She sucks young birds&rsquo; eggs,<br />
To make her voice clear,<br />
And the more she sings &ldquo;Cuckoo,&rdquo;<br />
The summer is quite near.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last two lines are varied thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then she sings, &ldquo;Cuckoo&rdquo;<br />
Three months in every year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when she sings &ldquo;Cuckoo&rdquo;<br />
The summer is near.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>The cuckoo was credited with sucking birds&rsquo; eggs, to make
room for her own, as well as to acquire a clear voice.&nbsp; Perhaps the
rustic belief is at fault here.&nbsp; The writer has seen a cuckoo rise
from the ground with an egg in her mouth, but he has seen it stated that
the cuckoo always lays her eggs on the ground, and carries them in her
mouth until she discovers a nest wherein to deposit them, and when she has
done this her mother&rsquo;s care is over.</p>
<h3>A White Cock.</h3>
<p>A white cock was looked upon as an unlucky bird, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Na chadw byth yn nghylch dy d&#375;,<br />
Na cheiliog gwyn, na chath ddu.</p>
<p>Never keep about thy house,<br />
A white cock, nor black cat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Crane.</h3>
<p>The crane is often mistaken for the heron.&nbsp; When the crane flies
against the stream, she asks for rain, when with the stream she asks for
fair weather.</p>
<p>This bird is said to be thin when the moon wanes, and fat at the waxing
of the moon.</p>
<h3>Ducks.</h3>
<p>When ducks sportively chase each other through the water, and flap their
wings and dive about, in evident enjoyment of their pastime, it is a sign
that rain is not far off.</p>
<h3>Eagle.</h3>
<p>Persons who had eaten eagle&rsquo;s flesh had power to cure erysipelas,
and this virtue was said by some to be transmitted to their descendants for
ever, whilst others affirmed it only lasted for nine generations.&nbsp; See
page 263, where this subject is fully treated.</p>
<h3><!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span><i>The Goat Sucker</i>.</h3>
<p>A curious notion prevailed respecting this bird, arrived at, presumably,
in consequence of its peculiar name&mdash;the <i>goat
sucker</i>&mdash;viz., that it lives on the milk of the goat, which it
obtains by sucking the teats of that animal.</p>
<h3>Putting Hens to Sit.</h3>
<p>Placing the eggs in the nest for hens, geese, and ducks to sit on was
considered an important undertaking.&nbsp; This was always done by the
lucky member of the family.&nbsp; It was usual to put fowl to sit so as to
get the chick out of the egg at the waxing, and not at the waning, of the
moon.&nbsp; It was thought that the young birds were strong or weak
according to the age of the moon when they were hatched.</p>
<p>March chickens were always considered the best.&nbsp; A game bird
hatched in March was thought to be stronger and more plucky than those that
broke their shells in any other month, and, further, to obtain all
extraneous advantages, that bird which was hatched at full moon began life
with very good prospects.</p>
<p>A singular custom prevailed at Llansantffraid, Montgomeryshire, when
putting hens, and other fowl, to sit.&nbsp; I obtained the information from
the late Vicar, the Rev. R. H. M. Hughes, M.A., an observant gentleman, who
took a lively interest in all matters connected with his parish.&nbsp; I
was staying with him, and he made the remark that in his parish it was
considered lucky to place the hen, when she first began to sit, with her
head towards the church.&nbsp; This the cottagers in the village could
easily do, for the parish church was in their midst.&nbsp; I do not know
whether this kind of proceeding prevailed in other places.</p>
<p>The number of eggs placed under a hen varied with her size, but one
general rule was followed, viz., an odd number of <!-- page 323--><a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>eggs was always
placed under her; eleven or thirteen was the usual number, but never ten or
twelve.</p>
<h3>The Heron.</h3>
<p>The heron as it flies slowly towards the source of a river is said to be
going up the river to bring the water down, in other words, this flight is
a sign of coming rain.&nbsp; The same thing is said of the crane.</p>
<h3>Fable of why the Heron frequents the banks of rivers and
lakes.</h3>
<p>It is from thirty to forty years ago that I heard the fable I am about
to relate, and the circumstances under which I heard it are briefly as
follows.&nbsp; I was walking towards Bangor from Llanllechid, when I saw a
farmer at work hedging.&nbsp; I stopped to chat with him, and a bramble
which had fastened itself on his trousers gave him a little trouble to get
it away, and the man in a pet said, &ldquo;Have I not paid thee thy
tithe?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you say those words, Enoch?&rdquo; said
I, and he said, &ldquo;Have you not heard the story?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
confessed my ignorance, and after many preliminary remarks, the farmer
related the following fable:&mdash;</p>
<p>The heron, the cat, and the bramble bought the tithe of a certain
parish.&nbsp; The heron bought the hay, mowed it, harvested it, and cocked
it, and intended carrying it the following day, but in the night a storm
came on, and carried the hay away, and ever since then the heron frequents
the banks of the rivers and lakes, looking for her hay that was carried
away, and saying &ldquo;Pay me my tithe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cat bought the oats, cut them, and even threshed them, and left them
in the barn, intending the following day to take them to the market for
sale.&nbsp; But when she went into the barn, early the next morning, she
found the floor covered with rats and mice, which had devoured the oats,
and the cat flew at them and fought with them, and <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>drove them from the
barn, and this is why she is at enmity with rats and mice even to our
day.</p>
<p>The bramble bought the wheat, and was more fortunate than the heron and
cat, for the wheat was bagged, and taken to the market and sold, but sold
on trust, and the bramble never got the money, and this is why it takes
hold of everyone and says &ldquo;Pay me my tithe,&rdquo; for it forgot to
whom the wheat had been sold.</p>
<h3>The Jackdaw.</h3>
<p>This bird is considered sacred, because it frequents church steeples and
builds its nest there, and it is said to be an innocent bird, though given
to carrying off things and hiding them in out-of-the-way places.&nbsp; When
ignorance of a fault is pleaded, it is a common saying&mdash;&ldquo;I have
no more knowledge of the fact than the Devil has of the jackdaw&rdquo; (see
<i>Bye-Gones</i>, Vol. I., 86).&nbsp; The Devil evidently will have nothing
to do with this bird, because it makes its home in the church steeple, and
he hates the church and everything belonging to it.</p>
<h3>The Magpie.</h3>
<p>The magpie was considered a bird of ill-omen.&nbsp; No one liked to see
a magpie when starting on a journey, but in certain parts of
Montgomeryshire, such as the parish of Llanwnog, <i>if the magpie flew from
left to right it foretold good luck</i>; in other parts, such as
Llansantffraid, if seen at all, it was considered a sign of bad luck.</p>
<p>However, fortunately, a person could make void this bad luck, for he had
only to spit on the ground, and make a cross with his finger, or stick,
through the spittle, and boldly say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Satan, I defy thee,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the curse, or bad luck, indicated by the appearance of the magpie,
could not then come.</p>
<p><!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>The number of magpies seen implied different events.&nbsp; It was
a common saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One&rsquo;s grief, two&rsquo;s mirth,<br />
Three&rsquo;s a marriage, four&rsquo;s a birth;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and another rendering of the above heard in Montgomeryshire
was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One for bad luck,<br />
Two for good luck,<br />
Three for a wedding,<br />
Four for a burying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another ditty is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One&rsquo;s joy, two&rsquo;s greet (crying),<br />
Three&rsquo;s a wedding, four&rsquo;s a sheet (death).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated above, one is grief, or bad luck, if it flies from right to
left, but if from left to right it implied success or joy.&nbsp; So these
various readings can only be reconciled by a little verbal explanation, but
&ldquo;four&rsquo;s a birth&rdquo; cannot be made to be an equivalent to
&ldquo;four&rsquo;s a sheet,&rdquo; a winding sheet, or a burying, by any
amount of ingenuity.</p>
<p>Should a magpie be seen stationary on a tree, it was believed that the
direction in which it took its flight foretold either success or disaster
to the person who observed it.&nbsp; If it flew to the left, bad luck was
to follow; if to the right, good luck; if straight, the journey could be
undertaken, provided the bird did not turn to the left whilst in sight, but
disappeared in that direction.</p>
<p>I heard the following tale in Denbighshire:&mdash;In days of old, a
company of men were stealthily making their way across the country to come
upon the enemy unawares.&nbsp; All at once they espied a magpie on a tree,
and by common consent they halted to see which way it would take its
flight, and thus foretell the fortune which would attend their
journey.&nbsp; One of the party, evidently an unbeliever in his
comrades&rsquo; superstition, noiselessly approached the <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>bird, and shot it
dead, to the great horror of his companions.&nbsp; The leader of the party,
in great anger, addressed the luckless archer&mdash;&ldquo;You have shot
the bird of fate, and you shall be shot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dauntless man
said, &ldquo;I shot the magpie, it is true, but if it could foretell our
fate, why could it not foresee its own?&rdquo;&nbsp; The archer&rsquo;s
reasoning was good, but I do not know whether people were convinced by
logic in those distant times, any more than they are in ours.</p>
<p>I will relate one other tale of the magpie, which I heard upwards of
twenty years ago in the parish of Llanwnog, Montgomeryshire.</p>
<p>I was speaking to a farmer&rsquo;s wife&mdash;whose name it is not
necessary to give, as it has nothing to do with the tale&mdash;when a
magpie flew across our view.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she ejaculated,
&ldquo;you naughty old thing, what do you want here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you think she brings bad luck with
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;I know
she does.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What makes you so positive,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that she brings bad luck with her?&rdquo;&nbsp; My question elicited
the following story.&nbsp; My friend commenced:&mdash;&ldquo;You know the
brook at the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; Well, my mother met with very bad
luck there, a good many years ago, and it was in this way&mdash;she was
going to Newtown fair, on our old horse, and she had a basket of eggs with
her.&nbsp; But, just as she was going to leave the &lsquo;fould,&rsquo; a
magpie flew before her.&nbsp; We begged of her not to go that
day&mdash;that bad luck would attend her.&nbsp; She would not listen to us,
but started off.&nbsp; However, she never got further than the brook, at
the bottom of the hill, for, when she got there, the old mare made straight
for the brook, and jerked the bridle out of mother&rsquo;s hand, and down
went the mare&rsquo;s head to drink, and off went the basket, and poor
mother too.&nbsp; All the eggs were broken, but I&rsquo;m glad to say
mother was not much the worse for her fall.&nbsp; But <!-- page 327--><a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>ever since then I
know it is unlucky to see a magpie.&nbsp; But sir,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;there is no bad luck for us to-day, for <i>the magpie flew from left
to right</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magpie was thought to be a great thief, and it was popularly
supposed that if its tongue were split into two with silver it could talk
like a man.</p>
<p>The cry of the magpie is a sign of rain.&nbsp; To man its dreaded notes
indicated disaster, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clyw grechwen nerth pen, iaith pi&mdash;yn addaw<br />
Newyddion drwg i mi.</p>
<p>List! the magpie&rsquo;s hoarse and bitter cry<br />
Shows that misfortune&rsquo;s sigh is nigh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this bird builds her nest at the top of a tree the summer will be
dry; if on the lower branches, the summer will be wet.</p>
<h3>The Owl.</h3>
<p>The hooting of an owl about a house was considered a sign of ill luck,
if not of death.&nbsp; This superstition has found a place in rhyme,
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Os y ddylluan ddaw i&rsquo;r fro,<br />
&nbsp;  Lle byddo rhywun afiach<br />
Dod yno i ddweyd y mae&rsquo;n ddin&acirc;d,<br />
&nbsp;  Na chaiff adferiad mwyach.<br />
If an owl comes to those parts,<br />
&nbsp;  Where some one sick is lying,<br />
She comes to say without a doubt,<br />
&nbsp;  That that sick one is dying.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Peacock.</h3>
<p>The peacock&rsquo;s shrill note is a sign of rain.&nbsp; Its call is
supposed to resemble the word <i>gwlaw</i>, the Welsh for rain.</p>
<h3>Pigeon.</h3>
<p>If the sick asks for a pigeon pie, or the flesh of a pigeon, it is a
sign that his death is near.</p>
<p>If the feathers of a pigeon be in a bed, the sick cannot die on it.</p>
<h3><!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span><i>The Raven</i>.</h3>
<p>The raven has ever enjoyed a notoriously bad name as a bird of
ill-omen.</p>
<p>He was one of those birds which the Jews were to have in abomination
(Lev., xi., 5-13).</p>
<p>But other nations besides the Jews dreaded the raven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The raven himself is hoarse<br />
That croaks the fatal entrance of<br />
Duncan under thy battlements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Macbeth</i>, Act i., s. 5.</p>
<p>Thus wrote Shakespeare, giving utterance to a superstition then
common.&nbsp; From these words it would seem that the raven was considered
a sign of evil augury to a person whose house was about to be entered by a
visitor, for his croaking forebode treachery.&nbsp; But the raven&rsquo;s
croaking was thought to foretell misfortune to a person about to enter
another&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; If he heard the croaking he had better turn
back, for an evil fate awaited him.</p>
<p>In Denmark the appearance of a raven in a village is considered an
indication that the parish priest is to die, or that the church is to be
burnt down that year.&nbsp; (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, vol. ii., second
series, p. 325.)&nbsp; The Danes of old prognosticated from the appearance
of the raven on their banners the result of a battle.&nbsp; If the banner
flapped, and exhibited the raven as alive, it augured success; if, however,
it moved not, defeat awaited them.</p>
<p>In Welsh there is a pretty saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duw a ddarpar i&rsquo;r fr&acirc;n.</p>
<p>God provides for the raven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this, after all, is only another rendering of the lovely
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your heavenly Father feedeth them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such words imply that the raven is a favoured bird.&nbsp; (See p.
304).</p>
<h3><!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span><i>Robin Redbreast</i>.</h3>
<p>Ill luck is thought to follow the killer of dear Robin Redbreast, the
children&rsquo;s winter friend.&nbsp; No one ever shoots Robin, nor do
children rob its nest, nor throw stones at it.&nbsp; Bad luck to anyone who
does so.&nbsp; The little bird with its wee body endeavoured to staunch the
blood flowing from the Saviour&rsquo;s side, and it has ever since retained
on its breast the stain of His sacred blood, and it consequently enjoys a
sacred life.&nbsp; It is safe from harm wherever English is spoken.</p>
<p>There is another legend, which is said to be extant in Carmarthenshire,
accounting for the Robin&rsquo;s <i>red breast</i>.&nbsp; It is given in
<i>Bye-Gones</i>, vol. i., p. 173, from Mr. Hardwick&rsquo;s
<i>Traditions</i>, <i>Superstitions</i>, <i>Folk-lore</i>,
<i>etc</i>.:&mdash;&ldquo;Far, far away, is a land of woe, darkness,
spirits of evil, and fire.&nbsp; Day by day does the little bird bear in
its bill a drop of water to quench the flame.&nbsp; So near to the burning
stream does he fly that his dear little feathers are scorched; and hence is
he named Bronchuddyn (qu. Bronrhuddyn), i.e., breast-burned, or
breast-scorched.&nbsp; To serve little children, the robin dares approach
the infernal pit.&nbsp; No good child will hurt the devoted benefactor of
man.&nbsp; The robin returns from the land of fire, and therefore he feels
the cold of winter far more than the other birds.&nbsp; He shivers in
brumal blasts, and hungry he chirps before your door.&nbsp; Oh, my child,
then, in pity throw a few crumbs to poor red-breast.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Sea Gull.</h3>
<p>It is believed that when sea gulls leave the sea for the mountains it is
a sign of stormy weather.</p>
<p>A few years ago I was walking from Corwen to Gwyddelwern, and I overtook
an aged man, and we entered into conversation.&nbsp; Noticing the sea gulls
hovering about, I said, there is going to be a storm.&nbsp; The answer of
my old <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>companion was, yes, for the sea gull says before starting from
the sea shore:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drychin, drychin,<br />
Awn i&rsquo;r eithin;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then when the storm is over, they say one to the other, before they
take their flight back again to the sea:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hindda, hindda,<br />
Awn i&rsquo;r morfa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which first couplet may be translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foul weather, foul weather,<br />
Let&rsquo;s go to the heather;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then the two last lines may be rendered:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The storm is no more,<br />
Let&rsquo;s go to the shore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the only occasion when I heard the above stanza, and I have
spoken to many aged Welshmen, and they had not heard the words, but every
one to whom I spoke believed that the sea gulls seen at a distance from the
sea was a sign of foul weather.</p>
<h3>The Swallow.</h3>
<p>The joy with which the first swallow is welcomed is almost if not quite
equal to the welcome given to the cuckoo.&nbsp; &ldquo;One swallow does not
make a summer&rdquo; is an old saw.</p>
<p>There is a superstition connected with the swallow that is common in
Wales, which is, that if it forsakes its old nest on a house, it is a sign
of ill luck to that house.&nbsp; But swallows rarely forsake their old
nests, and shortly after their arrival they are busily engaged in repairing
the breaches, which the storms of winter or mischievous children have made
in their abodes; and their pleasant twitterings are a pleasure to the
occupants of the house along which they build their nests, for the visit is
a sign of luck.</p>
<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>The flight of the swallow is a good weather sign.&nbsp; When the
swallow flies high in the air, it is a sign of fair weather; when, on the
other hand, it skims the earth, it is a sign of rain.</p>
<p>It was a great misfortune to break a swallow&rsquo;s nest,
for&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Y neb a doro nyth y wenol,<br />
Ni wel fwyniant yn dragwyddol.</p>
<p>Whoever breaks a swallow&rsquo;s nest,<br />
Shall forfeit everlasting rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Swan.</h3>
<p>The eggs of the swan are hatched by thunder and lightning.&nbsp; This
bird sings its own death song.</p>
<h3>The Swift.</h3>
<p>This bird&rsquo;s motions are looked upon as weather signs.&nbsp; Its
feeding regions are high up in the air when the weather is settled for
fair, and low down when rain is approaching.</p>
<p>Its screaming is supposed to indicate a change of weather from fair to
rain.</p>
<h3>Tit Major>, or Sawyer.</h3>
<p>The Rev. E. V. Owen, Vicar of Llwydiarth, Montgomeryshire, told me that
the Tit&rsquo;s notes are a sign of rain, at least, that it is so
considered in his parish.&nbsp; The people call the bird
&ldquo;Sawyer,&rdquo; and they say its notes resemble in sound the filing
of a saw.&nbsp; A man once said to my friend:&mdash;&ldquo;I dunna like to
hear that old sawyer whetting his saw.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not,&rdquo;
said Mr. Owen.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;ll rain afore
morning,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; This bird, if heard in February, when
the snow or frost is on the ground, indicates a breaking up of the
weather.&nbsp; Its sharp notes rapidly repeated several times in succession
are welcome sounds in hard weather, for they show that spring is
coming.</p>
<h3>The Wren.</h3>
<p>The Wren&rsquo;s life is sacred, excepting at one time of the year, for
should anyone take this wee birdie&rsquo;s life away, upon <!-- page
332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>him some
mishap will fall.&nbsp; The wren is classed with the Robin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The robin and the wren<br />
Are God&rsquo;s cock and hen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cruel sport of hunting the wren on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day, which
the writer has a dim recollection of having in his boyhood joined in, was
the one time in the year when the wren&rsquo;s life was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>The Rev. Silvan Evans, in a letter to the <i>Academy</i>, which has been
reproduced in <i>Bye-Gones</i>, vol. vii., p. 206, alludes to this sport in
these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something similar to the &lsquo;hunting of the wren&rsquo; was
not unknown to the Principality as late as about a century ago, or
later.&nbsp; In the Christmas holidays it was the custom of a certain
number of young men, not necessarily boys, to visit the abodes of such
couples as had been married within the year.&nbsp; The order of the
night&mdash;for it was strictly a nightly performance&mdash;was to this
effect.&nbsp; Having caught a wren, they placed it on a miniature bier made
for the occasion, and carried it in procession towards the house which they
intended to visit.&nbsp; Having arrived they serenaded the master and
mistress of the house under their bedroom window with the following
doggerel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dyma&rsquo;r dryw,<br />
Os yw e&rsquo;n fyw,<br />
Neu dderyn t&ocirc;<br />
I gael ei rostio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is the wren,<br />
If he is alive,<br />
Or a sparrow<br />
To be roasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they could not catch a wren for the occasion, it was lawful to
substitute a sparrow (ad eryn t&ocirc;).&nbsp; The husband, if agreeable,
would then open the door, admit the party, and <!-- page 333--><a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>regale them with
plenty of Christmas ale, the obtaining of which being the principal object
of the whole performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second line in the verse, &ldquo;<i>Os yw e&rsquo;n fyw</i>,&rdquo;
intimates that possibly the wren is dead&mdash;&ldquo;If he is
alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would generally be the case, as it was next to
impossible to secure the little thing until it had been thoroughly
exhausted, and then the act of pouncing upon it would itself put an end to
its existence.</p>
<p>Perhaps the English doggerel was intended to put an end to this cruel
sport, by intimating that the wee bird belonged to God, was one of His
creatures, and that therefore it should not be abused.</p>
<p>There is a Welsh couplet still in use:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pwy bynnag doro nyth y dryw,<br />
Ni chaiff ef weled wyneb Duw.</p>
<p>Whoever breaks a wren&rsquo;s nest,<br />
Shall never see God&rsquo;s face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This saying protects the snug little home of the wren.&nbsp; Much the
same thing is said of the Robin&rsquo;s nest, but I think this was put,
&ldquo;Whoever robs a robin&rsquo;s nest shall go to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Welsh couplet was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Y neb a doro nyth y dryw,<br />
Ni chaiff iechyd yn ei fyw.</p>
<p>Whoever breaks the wren&rsquo;s nest,<br />
Shall never enjoy good health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the robin and the wren were favourites of heaven, still it was
supposed that they were under some kind of curse, for it was believed that
the robin could not fly through a hedge, it must always fly over, whilst on
the other hand, the wren could not fly over a hedge, but it was obliged to
make its way through it.&nbsp; (See Robin, p. 329).</p>
<h3>The Wood Pigeon.</h3>
<p>The thrice repeated notes of five sounds, with an abrupt note at the
end, of which the cooing of the wood pigeon <!-- page 334--><a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>consists, have been
construed into words, and these words differ in different places, according
to the state of the country, and the prevailing sentiments of the
people.&nbsp; Of course, the language of the wood pigeon is always the
language of the people amongst whom he lives.&nbsp; He always speaks Welsh
in Wales, and English in England, but in these days this bird is so far
Anglicised that it blurts out English all along the borders of Wales.</p>
<p>In the cold spring days, when food is scarce and the wood pigeon cold,
it forms good resolutions, and says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yn yr haf<br />
T&#375; a wnaf;<br />
Gwnaf.</p>
<p>In the summer<br />
I&rsquo;ll make a house;<br />
I will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, when the summer has come with flower, and warmth, the wood
pigeon ridicules its former resolution and changes its song, for in June it
forgets January, and now it asks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yn yr ha&rsquo;<br />
T&#375; pwy wna&rsquo;?<br />
Pwy?</p>
<p>In the summer<br />
Who&rsquo;ll make a house?<br />
Who?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For then a house is quite unnecessary, and the trouble to erect one
great.&nbsp; The above ditty was told me by the Rev. John Williams, Rector
of Newtown, a native of Flintshire.</p>
<p>In the English counties bordering upon Wales, such as Herefordshire, the
wood pigeon encouraged Welshmen to drive off Englishmen&rsquo;s cattle to
their homes, by saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take two cows, Taffy,<br />
Take two cows, Taffy,<br />
Take two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>and ever since those days the same song is used; but another
version is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take two cows Davy,<br />
Take two cows Davy,<br />
Two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The late Rev. R. Williams, Rector of Llanfyllin, supplied me with the
above, and he stated that he obtained it from Herefordshire.</p>
<p>In the uplands of Denbighshire the poor wood pigeon has a hard time of
it in the winter, and, to make provision for the cold winter days, he, when
he sees the farmer sowing spring seeds, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dyn du, dyn da,<br />
Hau pys, hau ffa,<br />
Hau ffacbys i ni<br />
Fwyta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which rendered into English is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black man, good man,<br />
Sow peas, sow beans,<br />
Sow vetches for us<br />
To eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hugh Jones, Pentre Llyn Cymmer, a farmer in Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr,
a descendant of the bard Robert Davies, Nantglyn, supplied me with the
preceding ditty.</p>
<h3>The Magpie teaching a Wood Pigeon how to make a nest.</h3>
<p>The wood pigeon makes an untidy nest, consisting of a few bits of twigs
placed one on the other without much care.&nbsp; There is a fable in the
Iolo MSS., p. 159, in Welsh, and the translation appears on page 567 in
English, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p> The magpie, observing the slight knowledge of nest building possessed
by the wood pigeon, kindly undertook the work of giving his friend a lesson
in the art, and as the lesson proceeded, the wood pigeon, bowing, cooed
out:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Mi wn</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mi wn</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mi wn</i>!</p>
<p>I know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; I know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>The instructor was at first pleased with his apt pupil, and
proceeded with his lesson, but before another word could be uttered, the
bird swelling with pride at its own importance and knowledge, said
again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; I know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The magpie was annoyed at this ignorant assurance, and with bitter
sarcasm said: &ldquo;Since you know, do it then,&rdquo; and this is why the
wood pigeon&rsquo;s nest is so untidy in our days.&nbsp; In its own mind it
knew all about nest building, and was above receiving instruction, and
hence its present clumsy way of building its nest.&nbsp; This fable gave
rise to a proverb, &ldquo;As the wood pigeon said to the magpie: &lsquo;I
know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is believed that when wood pigeons are seen in large flocks it is a
sign of foul weather.</p>
<h3>Woodpecker.</h3>
<p>The woodpecker&rsquo;s screech was a sign of rain.&nbsp; This bird is
called by two names in Welsh which imply that it foretold storms; as,
<i>Ysgrech y coed</i>, the wood screech, and <i>Caseg y drycin</i>, the
storm mare.</p>
<p>These names have found a place in Welsh couplets:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ysgrech y coed!<br />
Mae&rsquo;r gwlaw yn dod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Woodpecker&rsquo;s cry!<br />
The rain is nigh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Bardd Nantglyn</i>, Robert Davies, Nantglyn, has an englyn to the
woodpecker:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I Gaseg y Drycin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och! rhag Caseg, gr&ecirc;g rwygiant,&mdash;y drycin,<br />
Draw accw yn y ceunant,<br />
Ar fol pren, uwch pen pant,<br />
Cyn &rsquo;storm yn canu &rsquo;sturmant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barddoniaeth R. Davies, p. 61.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>My friend Mr. Richard Williams, Celynog, Newtown, translates this
stanza as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah! &rsquo;tis the hoarse note of the Woodpecker,<br />
In yonder ravine,<br />
On the round trunk of a tree, above the hollow,<br />
Sounding his horn before the coming storm.</p>
<p><i>Yellow Hammer</i>.&nbsp; (<i>Penmelyn yr Eithin</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a strange belief in Wales that this bird sacrifices her young
to feed snakes.</p>
<h3>Ass.</h3>
<p>The stripe over the shoulders of the ass is said to have been made by
our Lord when He rode into Jerusalem on an ass, and ever since the mark
remains.</p>
<p>It was thought that the milk of an ass could cure the
&ldquo;decay,&rdquo; or consumption.&nbsp; This faith was common fifty
years ago in Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; I do not know whether it is
so now.&nbsp; People then believed that ass&rsquo;s milk was more
nutritious than other kind of food for persons whose constitutions were
weak.</p>
<h3>The Bee.</h3>
<p>The little busy bee has been from times of old an object of admiration
and superstition.&nbsp; It is thought that they are sufficiently sensitive
to feel a slight, and sufficiently vindictive to resent one, and as they
are too valuable to be carelessly provoked to anger, they are variously
propitiated by the cottager when their wrath is supposed to have been
roused.&nbsp; It is even thought that they take an interest in human
affairs; and it is, therefore, considered expedient to give them formal
notice of certain occurrences.</p>
<h3>Buying a Hive of Bees.</h3>
<p>In the central parts of Denbighshire people suppose that a hive of bees,
if bought, will not thrive, but that a present of a hive leads to its
well-doing.</p>
<p><!-- page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>A cottager in Efenechtyd informed the writer that a friend gave
her the hive she had, and that consequently she had had luck with it; but,
she added, &ldquo;had I bought it, I could not have expected anything from
it, for bought hives do badly.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was in the centre of
Denbighshire.</p>
<h3>Time of Bee Swarming.</h3>
<p>The month in which bees swarm is considered of the greatest importance,
and undoubtedly it is so, for the sooner they swarm, the longer their
summer, and therefore the greater the quantity of honey which they will
accumulate.&nbsp; A late swarm cannot gather honey from every opening
flower, because the flower season will have partly passed away before they
leave their old home.</p>
<p>This faith has found expression in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A swarm of bees in May<br />
Is worth a load of hay;<br />
A swarm of bees in June<br />
Is worth a silver spoon;<br />
A swarm of bees in July<br />
Is not worth a fly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words are often uttered by cottagers when a swarm takes place in
the respective months named in the lines.&nbsp; It is really very seldom
that a swarm takes place in our days in May, and many a swarm takes place
in July which is of more value than a fly, But however, be this as it may,
the rhyme expresses the belief of many people.</p>
<h3>The Day of Swarming.</h3>
<p>Sunday is the favourite day for bee swarming.&nbsp; Country people say,
when looking at their bees clustering outside the hive, and dangling like a
rope from it, &ldquo;Oh, they won&rsquo;t swarm until next Sunday,&rdquo;
and it is true that they are often right in their calculations, for bees
seem to prefer the peaceful Day of Rest to all other days for their
flight.&nbsp; The <!-- page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>kettle and pan beating are often heard of a
Sunday in those parts of the country where bees are reared.&nbsp; It is
possible that the quietness of the day, and the cessation of every-day
noise, is appreciated by the little creatures, and that this prevailing
stillness entices them to take then their flight from their old home to
seek a new one.</p>
<h3>Luck comes with a Strange Swarm.</h3>
<p>It is considered very lucky indeed to find that a strange swarm of bees
has arrived in the garden, or tree, belonging to a cottager.&nbsp; The
advent of the bees is joyfully welcomed, and the conversation of the
neighbours on such an occasion intimates that they think that good fortune
has come with them to the person whom they have condescended to honour with
their presence.</p>
<p>Occasionally, if bees settle down on property of doubtful ownership, a
good deal of wrangling and bad feeling arises between the rival claimants
for their possession.</p>
<h3>It is considered unlucky for Bees to fly away from their
owner.</h3>
<p>As the coming of a strange swarm of bees is indicative of good luck to
the person to whom they come, so the decamping of a swarm shows that
misfortune is about to visit the person whom they leave.</p>
<h3>Bees in a Roof.</h3>
<p>It was thought lucky when bees made their home in the roof, or indeed in
any part of a house, and this they could easily do when houses were
thatched with straw.&nbsp; Many a swarm of bees found shelter in the roofs
of ancient churches, but in our days bees are seldom found in either houses
or churches.</p>
<h3>Informing Bees of a Death in a Family.</h3>
<p>Formerly it was the custom to tell the bees of a death in the
family.&nbsp; The head of the house whispered the news to <!-- page
340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>the bees in
the hive.&nbsp; If this were neglected, it was thought that another death
would soon follow the previous one.&nbsp; Instead of speaking to the bees,
it was the custom, in some parts of Wales, to turn the bee-hive round
before starting the funeral.&nbsp; This was always done by the
representative of the family, and it also was thought to be a protection
against death.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones, Rhydycroesau Rectory, informed me that an old man, David
Roberts of Llanyblodwel, once came to her in deep grief, after the funeral
of his grandchild, because he had forgotten to turn the bee-hive before the
funeral started for the church.&nbsp; He said that he was in such distress
at the loss of the child, that he had neglected to tell the bees of the
death, and, said he, some other member of the family is now sure to
go.&nbsp; He informed Mrs. Jones that he had turned the hive at the death
of his old woman, and that consequently no death had followed hers in his
family.</p>
<h3>Putting Bees in Mourning.</h3>
<p>This is done after a death in a family, and the bees are put into
mourning by tying a piece of black ribbon on a bit of wood, and inserting
it into the hole at the top of the hive.</p>
<h3>Stolen Bees.</h3>
<p>It was believed that stolen bees would not make honey, and that the hive
which had been stolen would die.</p>
<h3>A Swarm entering a House.</h3>
<p>Should a swarm enter a house, it was considered unlucky, and usually it
was a sign of death to someone living in that house.</p>
<p>The culture of bees was once more common than it is, and therefore they
were much observed, and consequently they figure in the folk-lore of most
nations.</p>
<h3>Cat.</h3>
<p>The cat was thought to be a capital weather glass.&nbsp; If she stood or
lay with her face towards the fire, it was a sign of <!-- page 341--><a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>frost or snow; if she
became frisky, bad weather was near.&nbsp; If the cat washed her face,
strangers might be expected; and if she washed her face and ears, then rain
was sure to come.&nbsp; A <i>black</i> cat was supposed to bring luck to a
house, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cath ddu, mi glywais dd&rsquo;wedyd,<br />
A fedr swyno hefyd,<br />
A chadw&rsquo;r teulu lle mae&rsquo;n hyw<br />
O afael pob rhyw glefyd.</p>
<p>A black cat, I&rsquo;ve heard it said,<br />
Can charm all ill away,<br />
And keep the house wherein she dwells<br />
From fever&rsquo;s deadly sway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cats born in May, or May cats, were no favourites.&nbsp; They were
supposed to bring snakes or adders into the house.&nbsp; This supposition
has found utterance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cathod mis Mai<br />
Ddaw a nadrodd i&rsquo;r tai.</p>
<p>Cats born in May<br />
Bring snakes to the house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some parts the black cat was otherwise thought of than is stated
above, for this injunction is heard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Na chadw byth yn nghylch dy d&#375;<br />
Na cheiliog gwyn na chath ddu.</p>
<p>Never keep about thy house<br />
A white cock or <i>black</i> puss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cats are so tenacious of life that they are said to have nine
lives.&nbsp; We have already spoken of witches transforming themselves into
cats.</p>
<p>A singular superstition connected with cats is the supposition that they
indicate the place to which the dead have gone by ascending or descending
trees immediately after the death of a person.</p>
<p>The Rev. P. W. Sparling, Rector of Erbistock, informed me that one day a
parishioner met him, and told him that his brother, who had lately died,
was in hell, and that he <!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>wished the Rector to get him out.&nbsp; Mr.
Sparling asked him how he knew where his brother was, and in answer the man
said that he knew, because he had seen his brother in the form of a white
cat descend a tree immediately after his death.&nbsp; On further inquiry,
the man stated that since the cat came <i>down the tree</i>, it was a sign
that his brother had gone down to hell; but had the cat <i>gone up the
tree</i>, it would have shown that he had gone up to heaven.</p>
<p>I have heard it stated, but by whom I have forgotten, that if a
<i>black</i> cat leaves a house where a person dies, immediately after that
person&rsquo;s death, it shows he has gone to the bad place; but if a white
cat, that he has gone to heaven.</p>
<h3>Cows.</h3>
<h4><i>Cows Kneeling on Christmas Morn.</i></h4>
<p>In the upland parishes of Wales, particularly those in Montgomeryshire,
it was said, and that not so long ago, that cows knelt at midnight on
Christmas eve, to adore the infant Saviour.&nbsp; This has been affirmed by
those who have witnessed the strange occurrence.</p>
<p>Cows bringing forth two calves are believed to bring luck to a farmer;
but in some parts of Wales a contrary view is taken of this matter.</p>
<p>If the new born calf is seen by the mistress of the house with its head
towards her, as she enters the cowhouse to view her new charge and
property, it is a lucky omen, but should any other part of the calf present
itself to the mistress&rsquo;s view, it is a sign of bad luck.</p>
<p>Witches were thought to have great power over cows, and it was not
unusual for farmers to think that their cows, if they did not thrive, had
been bewitched.</p>
<h3>Crickets.</h3>
<p>It is lucky to have crickets in a house, and to kill one is sure to
bring bad luck after it.&nbsp; If they are very numerous <!-- page 343--><a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>in a house, it is a
sign that peace and plenty reign there.&nbsp; The bakehouse in which their
merry chirp is heard is the place to bake your bread, for it is a certain
sign that the bread baked there will turn out well.</p>
<p>An aged female Welsh friend in Porthywaen told me that it is a sign of
death for crickets to leave a house, and she proved her case by an apt
illustration.&nbsp; She named all the parties concerned in the following
tale:&mdash;&ldquo;There were hundreds of crickets in . . . house; they
were &lsquo;sniving,&rsquo; swarming, all about the house, and were often
to be seen outside the house, or at least heard, and some of them perched
on the wicket to the garden; but all at once they left the place, and very
soon afterwards the son died.&nbsp; The crickets, she said, knew that a
death was about to take place, and they all left that house, going no one
knew where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not thought right to look at the cricket, much less to hurt
it.&nbsp; The warm fireplace, with its misplaced or displaced stones, was
not to be repaired, lest the crickets should be disturbed, and forsake the
place, and take with them good luck.&nbsp; They had, therefore, many snug,
warm holes in and about the chimneys.&nbsp; Crickets are not so plentiful
in Wales as they once were.</p>
<h3>Hare.</h3>
<p><i>C&aelig;sar</i>, bk. v., ch. xii., states that the Celts &ldquo;do
not regard it lawful to eat the <i>hare</i>, the cock, and the goose; they,
however, breed them for amusement and pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; This gives a
respectable age to the superstitions respecting these animals.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made of witches turning themselves into
hares.&nbsp; This superstition was common in all parts of North
Wales.&nbsp; The Rev. Lewis Williams, rector of Prion, near Denbigh, told
me the following tales of this belief:&mdash;A witch that troubled a farmer
in the shape of a hare, was <!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>shot by him.&nbsp; She then transformed
herself into her natural form, but ever afterwards retained the marks of
the shot in her nose.</p>
<p>Another tale which the same gentleman told me was the following:&mdash;A
farmer was troubled by a hare that greatly annoyed him, and seemed to make
sport of him.&nbsp; He suspected it was no hare, but a witch, so he
determined to rid himself of her repeated visits.&nbsp; One day, spying his
opportunity, he fired at her.&nbsp; She made a terrible noise, and jumped
about in a frightful manner, and then lay as if dead.&nbsp; The man went up
to her, but instead of a dead hare, he saw something on the ground as big
as a donkey.&nbsp; He dug a hole, and buried the thing, and was never
afterwards troubled by hare or witch.</p>
<p>In Llanerfyl parish there is a story of a cottager who had only one cow,
but she took to Llanfair market more butter than the biggest farmer in the
parish.&nbsp; She was suspected of being a witch, and was watched.&nbsp; At
last the watcher saw a hare with a tin-milk-can hanging from its neck, and
it was moving among the cows, milking them into her tin-can.&nbsp; The man
shot it, and it made for the abode of the suspected witch.&nbsp; When he
entered, he found her on the bed bleeding.</p>
<p>It was supposed that there was something uncanny about hares.&nbsp;
Rowland Williams, Parish Clerk, Efenechtyd, an aged man, related to me the
following tale, and he gave the name of the party concerned, but I took no
note of the name, and I have forgotten it:&mdash;A man on his way one
Sunday to Efenechtyd Church saw a hare on its form.&nbsp; He turned back
for his gun, and fired at the hare.&nbsp; The following Sunday he saw again
a hare on the very same spot, and it lifted its head and actually stared at
him.&nbsp; The man was frightened and went to church; the third Sunday he
again saw a hare <!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>on the very same form, and this hare also
boldly looked at him.&nbsp; This third appearance thoroughly convinced the
man that there was something wrong somewhere, and he afterwards avoided
that particular place.</p>
<p>The pretty legend of Melangell, called Monacella, the patroness of
hares, is well known.&nbsp; One day the Prince of Powis chased a hare,
which took refuge under the robe of the virgin Melangell, who was engaged
in deep devotion.&nbsp; The hare boldly faced the hounds, and the dogs
retired to a distance howling, and they could not be induced to seize their
prey.&nbsp; The Prince gave to God and Melangell a piece of land to be
henceforth a sanctuary.&nbsp; The legend of the hare and the saint is
represented in carved wood on the gallery in the church of Pennant.&nbsp;
Formerly it belonged to the screen.&nbsp; Hares were once called in the
parish of Pennant Melangell <i>Wyn Melangell</i>, or St. Monacella&rsquo;s
lambs.&nbsp; Until the last century no one in the parish would kill a hare,
and it was believed that if anyone cried out when a hare was being pursued,
&ldquo;God and St. Monacella be with thee,&rdquo; it would escape.</p>
<h3>Haddock.</h3>
<p>The haddock has a dark spot on each side its gills, and superstition
ascribes these marks to the impression of S. Peter&rsquo;s thumb and
finger, when he took the tribute money out of the mouth of a fish of the
same species in the sea of Galilee.</p>
<h3>Hedgehog.</h3>
<p>It was believed that hedgehogs sucked cows, and so firmly were the
people convinced of this fact, that this useful little animal was doomed to
death, and I have seen in many Churchwardens&rsquo; accounts entries to the
effect that they had paid sums of money for its destruction.&nbsp; The
amount given in most parishes was two pence.&nbsp; I will give a few
entries, <!-- page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>from many that I have by me, to show that parishes paid this sum
for dead hedgehogs.</p>
<p>In Cilcen Churchwardens&rsquo; Accounts for the year 1710 I find the
following entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Edward Lloyd for killing a hedgehog 00. 00. 02.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One hundred years afterwards I find in Llanasa Churchwardens&rsquo;
Accounts for 1810-1811 this entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9 hedgogs&nbsp;  ...&nbsp;  ...&nbsp;  ...&nbsp;  1. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was thought, should the cow&rsquo;s teats be swollen of a morning,
that she had been sucked the previous night by a hedgehog.</p>
<p>Formerly dead hedgehogs could be seen in company with foxes, polecats,
and other vermin suspended from the boughs of the churchyard yew trees, to
prove that the Churchwardens paid for work actually done.</p>
<h3>Horse.</h3>
<p>A white horse figures in the superstition of school children.&nbsp; When
the writer was a lad in school at Llanidloes, it was believed that if a
white horse were met in the morning it was considered lucky, and should the
boy who first saw the horse spit on the ground, and stealthily make the
sign of a cross with his toe across the spittle, he was certain to find a
coin on the road, or have a piece of money given to him before the day was
over; but he was not to divulge to anyone what he had done, and for the
working of the charm it was required that he should make sure that the
horse was perfectly white, without any black hairs in any part of the
body.</p>
<p>In Welshpool a like superstition prevails.&nbsp; Mr. Copnall, the master
of the Boys&rsquo; National School in that town, has kindly supplied me
with the following account of this matter:&mdash;&ldquo;It is lucky to meet
a white horse on the road, if, when you meet it, you spit three times over
your little finger; if you <!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>neglect this charm you will be unlucky.&nbsp;
I asked the children if it signified whether it was the little finger on
the right or left hand; some boys said the left, but the majority said it
made no difference which hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said that horses could see spirits, and that they could never be
induced to proceed as long as the spirit stood before them.&nbsp; They
perspired and trembled whilst the spirit blocked the way, but when it had
disappeared, then the horses would go on.</p>
<h3>Lady-bird.</h3>
<p>This pretty spotted little beetle was used formerly in the neighbourhood
of Llanidloes as a prognosticator of the weather.&nbsp; First of all the
lady-bird was placed in the palm of the left hand, or right; I do not think
it made any difference which hand was used, and the person who held it
addressed it as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&acirc;r fach goch, gwtta,<br />
Pa un ai gwlaw, neu hindda?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then having said these words, the insect was thrown skywards, the
person repeating the while&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Os mai gwlaw, cwympa lawr,<br />
Os mai t&ecirc;g, hedfana;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which in English would be&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lady-bird, lady-bird, tell to me<br />
What the weather is going to be;<br />
If fair, then fly in the air,<br />
If foul, then fall to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two lines were said with the beetle in the hand, and the last
two whilst it was thrown upwards; if it came to the ground without
attempting to fly, it indicated rain; if, however, when thrown into the air
it flew away, then fair weather was to be expected.&nbsp; The writer has
often resorted to this test, but whether he found it true or false he
cannot now say.</p>
<h3><!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span><i>Mice</i>.</h3>
<p>A mouse nibbling clothes was a sign of disaster, if not death, to the
owner.&nbsp; It was thought that the evil one occasionally took the form of
a mouse.&nbsp; Years ago, when Craig Wen Farm, Llawr-y-glyn, near
Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire was haunted&mdash;the rumour of which event I
well remember&mdash;the servant girl told her mistress, the tenant of the
farm, that one day she was going through the corn field, and that a mouse
ran before her, and she ran after it to catch it, but that when she was
opposite the barn, <i>the mouse stopped and laughed at her</i>, and ran
into a hole.&nbsp; The mouse, therefore, was the evil spirit, and the cause
of all the mischief that followed.</p>
<h3>Moles.</h3>
<p>Moles are said to have no eyes.&nbsp; If mole hills move there will be a
thaw.&nbsp; By the moving of mole hills is meant bits of earth tumbling off
the mound.&nbsp; A labourer in Llanmerewig parish, Montgomeryshire, called
my attention to this fact.&nbsp; It was a frosty day, and apparently no
change was near, but it will thaw, said he, and certain I am, that by the
next morning a thaw had set in.</p>
<h3>Pigs.</h3>
<p>Pigs used to be credited with the power of seeing the wind.&nbsp; Devils
were fond of assuming the form of, or entering into, pigs.&nbsp; Pigs
littered in February could not be reared.&nbsp; This I was told by a native
of Llansantffraid, Montgomeryshire.</p>
<h3>The Snake, Serpent.</h3>
<p>The snake was supposed to be able to understand what men said.&nbsp; A
tale was told me by an aged man at Penrhos, Montgomeryshire, of an event
which took place in the last century.&nbsp; His father, he said, saw a
number of snakes, or <i>nethers</i>, as he called them, basking in the sun,
and he said when passing them, &ldquo;I will make you jump
to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next day he, provided with a rod, passed the
spot, but no <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>adder could be seen.&nbsp; The next day he passed again the same
spot without his rod, and the man was now obliged to run for his life, so
furiously did the snakes attack him.</p>
<p>Traditions of Flying Snakes were once common in all parts of Wales.</p>
<h3>Flying Serpents.</h3>
<p>The traditional origin of these imaginary creatures was that they were
snakes, which by having drunk the milk of a woman, and by having eaten of
bread consecrated for the Holy Communion, became transformed into winged
serpents or dragons.</p>
<p>These dangerous creatures had their lurking places in many districts,
and they attacked everyone that crossed their paths.&nbsp; There was said
to have been one such den on Moel Bentyrch.&nbsp; Old Mrs. Davies, Plas,
Dolanog, who died 1890, aged 92, told the Rev. D. R. Evans, B.A., son of
the Vicar of Dolanog, that once, when she was a young woman, she went to
Llanfair market, and on the way she sat on a stile, and she saw smoke and
fire issuing from a hole on Moel Bentyrch, where the <i>Gwiber</i>, or
Flying Serpent, had its abode.&nbsp; She ran, and never stopped until she
had placed a good distance between her and the hill.&nbsp; She believed
that both the smoke and fire were caused by the serpent.&nbsp; There is
also a tradition still current in Dolanog that this flying serpent was
destroyed by wrapping some red material round a post into which sharp nails
were driven.&nbsp; The serpent, attacking this post with furious
onslaughts, was lacerated by the sharp spikes, and died.&nbsp; A like
tradition is current in Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant in connection with the
<i>Post Coch</i>, or <i>Post-y-Wiber</i>, or Maen Hir y Maes-Mochnant.</p>
<p>Mr. Hancock in his &ldquo;History of Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant,&rdquo;
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The legend connected with this stone pillar is, that it was
raised in order to prevent the devastation which a <!-- page 350--><a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>winged serpent or
dragon (a <i>Wiber</i>) was committing in the surrounding country.&nbsp;
The stone was draped with scarlet cloth, to allure and excite the creature
to a furor, scarlet being a colour most intolerably hateful and provoking
to it.&nbsp; It was studded with iron spikes, that the reptile might wound
or kill itself by beating itself against it.&nbsp; Its destruction, it is
alleged, was effected by this artifice.&nbsp; It is said to have had two
lurking places in the neighbourhood, which are still called
<i>Nant-y-Wiber</i>, one at Penygarnedd, the other near Bwlch Sychtyn, in
the parish of Llansilin, and this post was in the direct line of its
flight.&nbsp; Similar legends referring to winged serpents exist in various
parts of Wales.&nbsp; In the adjoining parish of Llanarmon-Dyffryn-Ceiriog
there is a place called <i>Sarffle</i> (the serpent&rsquo;s
hole).&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Montgomeryshire Collections</i>, vol. ix., 237.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Snake Rings, or Glain Nadroedd.</h3>
<p>Mention is made in <i>Camden</i> of snake rings.&nbsp; Omitting certain
remarks not connected with the matter directly, he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;In
some parts of Wales we find it a common opinion of the vulgar that about
Midsummer Eve (though in the time they do not all agree) &rsquo;tis usual
for snakes to meet in companies, and that by joyning heads together and
hissing, a kind of Bubble is form&rsquo;d like a ring about the head of one
of them, which the rest by continual hissing, blow on till it comes off at
the tail, and then it immediately hardens, and resembles a glass ring;
which whoever finds (as some old women and children are persuaded) shall
prosper in all his undertakings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The above quotation is in
Gibson&rsquo;s additions to Camden, and it correctly states the popular
opinion.&nbsp; Many of these rings formerly existed, and they seemed to be
simply glass rings.&nbsp; They were thought to possess many healing
virtues, as, for instance, it could cure wens and whooping cough, and I
believe I have heard it said that it could cure the bite of a mad dog.</p>
<h3><!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span><i>Sheep</i>.</h3>
<p>It was thought that the devil could assume any animal&rsquo;s form
excepting that of the sheep.&nbsp; This saying, however, is somewhat
different from what a farmer friend told me of <i>black sheep</i>.&nbsp; He
said his father, and other farmers as well, were in the habit of killing
all their black lambs, because they were of the same colour as the devil,
and the owners were afraid that Satan had entered, or would enter into
them, and that therefore these sheep were destroyed.&nbsp; He stated that
his father went on his knees on the ground and prayed, either before or
after he had killed the black lambs.&nbsp; It is a common saying that the
black sheep is the ringleader of all mischief in a flock of sheep.&nbsp;
The expression, &ldquo;He is a black sheep,&rdquo; as applied to a person,
conveys the idea that he is a worthless being, inclined to everything that
is bad.</p>
<p>It is even now in country places thought to be a lucky omen if anyone
sees the head of the first spring lamb towards him.&nbsp; This foretells a
lucky and prosperous year to the person whose eyes are thus greeted.</p>
<h3>Spider.</h3>
<p>The long-legged spider, or, as it is generally called in Wales, the
Tailor, is an object of cruel sport to children.&nbsp; They catch it, and
then handle it roughly, saying the while:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Harry long-leg<br />
Cannot say his prayers,<br />
Catch him by the right leg,<br />
Catch him by the left leg.<br />
And throw him down stairs;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then one leg after the other is plucked off, and the poor creature
is left to die miserably.&nbsp; This was done in Llanidloes.</p>
<h3>The Squirrel.</h3>
<p>Hunting this sprightly little animal became at Christmas the sport of
our rustic population.&nbsp; A number of lads <!-- page 352--><a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>gathered together,
and proceeded to the woods to hunt the squirrel.&nbsp; They followed it
with stones and sticks from tree to tree, shouting and screaming, to
frighten it on and on, until it was quite unable to make further progress,
and then they caught it.&nbsp; The writer, when a lad, has often joined in
this cruel hunt, but whether the squirrel was killed when caught he is
unable to recall to mind.&nbsp; Generally it escaped.</p>
<h3>The Blind Worm, or Slow Worm.</h3>
<p>This reptile is a snake, varying from twelve to eighteen inches
long.&nbsp; Its head is small, and its movements very rapid.&nbsp; At the
slightest noise, it darts away in a moment, and hides among rocks, stones,
or rank grass.&nbsp; It is said to have no eyes, but this is a popular
mistake&mdash;hence, however, its name, <i>Blind Worm</i>.&nbsp; This
beautiful timid creature is often wantonly cut into pieces by its cruel and
mistaken captors, for they credit it with the possession of evil
propensities.&nbsp; It is said that, could it see, it would be a formidable
enemy to man and beast.&nbsp; This supposition has found strength and
sanction in doggerel verse.&nbsp; The Blind Worm is said to address the
adder as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I could see,<br />
As well as thee,<br />
Man nor beast<br />
Should ne&rsquo;er pass me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another version of these lines, heard in Shropshire, on the borders of
Wales, is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I had one eye,<br />
As thou hast two,<br />
No man should live,<br />
Nor beast should loo (low).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These doggerel lines indicate clearly the dread in which this innocent
snake is held.</p>

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
